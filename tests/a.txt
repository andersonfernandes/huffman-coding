WARNING:  THIS WALK-THRU SHOWS HOW TO SOLVE THIS ADVENTURE STEP BY STEP, THESE
ARE NOT HINTS!

SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS ARE ENCLOSED IN QUOTES, SO TYPE WHAT YOU SEE.

START OFF BY GOING "N".  YOU ARE NOW STANDING AT THE END OF A ROAD BEFORE A
SMALL BRICK BUILDING.  THIS BUILDING IS THE WELLHOUSE, AND IS AN IMPORTANT PART
OF THE GAME.  THE OBJECT OF THIS GAME IS TO GET THE 15 TREASURES BACK TO THE
WELLHOUSE.

CONTINUE WITH "IN", AND YOU ARE INSIDE THE WELL HOUSE, SO "GET FOOD", "GET
LAMP", "GET KEYS", "GET BOTTLE".  NOW, THERE ARE THREE MAGIC WORDS YOU NEED TO
USE.  THEY ARE PLUGH, XYZZY AND PLOVER.  TWO OF THESE WORDS ARE USED TO GET TO
AND FROM THE WELLHOUSE AND PARTS OF THE CAVE.  THE THIRD, PLOVER IS USED TO GET
BETWEEN TWO PARTS OF THE CAVE.	ANOTHER THING TO REMEMBER IS THAT YOUR LAMP
LIGHT IS LIMITED, SO TURN OFF YOUR LAMP WHEN YOU DO NOT NEED IT!

NOW ON TO THE CAVE.  SAY "PLUGH", THEN "LAMP ON", "S", "GET SILVER", "DROP
KEYS", "DROP FOOD", "DROP BOTTLE", "N".  YOU ARE NOW BACK AT Y2.  HERE IS WHERE
YOU USE PLOVER.  SO SAY "PLOVER", THEN "NE", "GET PYRAMID", "S", "LAMP OFF",
"DROP LAMP", "DROP SILVER", "DROP PYRAMID", "GET EMERALD", "W", "DROP EMERALD",
"BACK".  THE REASON YOU DID ALL OF THAT WAS THAT THE ONLY WAY TO GET THE
EMERALD OUT OF THE PLOVER ROOM IS OUT THROUGH THE CRACK, BUT YOU CAN NOT CARRY
ANYTHING ELSE WITH YOU.

NOW "GET LAMP", "GET SILVER", "GET PYRAMID", THEN "PLOVER" AND "PLUGH".  YOU
ARE NOW BACK IN THE WELLHOUSE, SO DROP OFF YOUR TREASURES SO FAR.  TYPE "DROP
SILVER", "DROP PYRAMID".  BACK TO THE CAVE WITH "XYZZY", AND "LAMP ON", "E",
"GET CAGE", "W", "GET ROD", "W", "W","DROP ROD", "GET BIRD", "GET ROD", "W",
"D","W", "WAVE ROD".  THERE IS NOW A CRYSTAL BRIDGE ACROSS THE CHASM.  CONTINUE
WITH "DROP ROD", THEN GO "W", "GET DIAMONDS", "E", "E", "S", "GET GOLD", "N",
"D".  AT THIS POINT YOU WILL SEE A HUGE GREEN SNAKE BARING YOUR WAY.  TO BE RID
OF THE SNAKE, "DROP BIRD", AND THE SNAKE IS DRIVEN AWAY.

AT THIS POINT I NEED TO EXPLAIN SOMETHING ELSE.  DURING THE COURSE OF THE
GAME, A DWARF WILL SEEK YOU OUT AND THROW AN AXE AT YOU.  GET THE AXE.	THE
NEXT TIME YOU SEE THE DWARF, THROW THE AXE AT HIM TO KILL HIM.	THIS MAY HAPPEN
SEVERAL TIMES, SO JUST KEEP KILLING THE DWARVES.  ANOTHER PERSON TO WATCH OUT
FOR IS THE PIRATE.  HE WILL SHOW UP AT SOME POINT IN THE GAME, AND STEAL
WHATEVER TREASURES YOU ARE CARRYING.  IF THIS HAPPENS, YOU CAN GET THE
TREASURES BACK WHEN YOU FIND HIS TREASURE CHEST.

CONTINUE WITH "DROP CAGE", "SW", "W".  HERE IS A DRAGON SITTING ON A PERSIAN
RUG.  YOU NEED TO KILL THE DRAGON TO GET THE RUG SO TYPE "KILL DRAGON".  THE
GAME WILL RESPOND WITH "WITH WHAT?  YOUR BARE HANDS?".  ANSWER "YES".
CONGRATULATIONS, YOU HAVE NOW KILLED THE DRAGON!.  SO, "GET RUG", THEN "E",
"E", "S", "GET JEWELRY", "N", "W", "GET COINS", "E", "N", "N", "LAMP OFF", AND
"PLUGH".  YOU ARE AGAIN BACK IN THE WELLHOUSE, SO DROP YOUR TREASURES WITH
"DROP DIAMONDS", "DROP GOLD", "DROP RUG", "DROP JEWELRY", "DROP COINS".  BACK
TO THE CAVE WITH "PLUGH", THEN "LAMP ON", "S", "GET FOOD", "GET KEYS", "GET
BOTTLE", "D", "W", "D", "W", "W", THEN SAY "ORIENTAL" TO GET TO THE ORIENTAL
ROOM.  THEN "GET VASE", "W", "DROP KEYS", "DROP FOOD", "BACK", "N", "W", AND
YOU HAVE NOW FOUND THE EMERALD YOU PREVIOUSLY PLACED THERE.  SO "GET EMERALD",
"NW", "S", "SE", "E", "GET PILLOW".  THE PILLOW IS USED TO PLACE THE VASE ON,
SO YOU DON'T BREAK IT.

NOW GO "BACK", "W", "W", "D", "WATER PLANT", "U".  THE PLANT IS CRYING FOR MORE
WATER, SO NOW YOU NEED TO GO GET IT SOME WATER.  BUT BEFORE YOU DO THAT DROP
OFF YOUR TREASURES AT THE WELL- HOUSE BY GOING "E", "E", "NE", "E", "U", "E",
"U", "N", "LAMP OFF", "PLUGH" AND YOU ARE BACK IN THE WELLHOUSE.  SO "DROP
PILLOW", "DROP VASE", "DROP EMERALD".

BACK TO THE CAVE WITH "PLUGH", "LAMP ON", "S", "D", "E", "D", "FILL BOTTLE".
YOUR BOTTLE IS NOW FILLED WITH WATER, SO GO "U", "W", "W", "D", "W", "W", "W",
"W", "D", "WATER PLANT", "U", "E", "D", "GET OIL", "U", "W", "D".  NOW YOU CAN
CLIMB THE BEANSTALK SO, "CLIMB", "W", "GET EGGS", "N", "OIL DOOR", "DROP
BOTTLE", "N", "GET TRIDENT", "W", "D", "DROP TRIDENT", "GET KEYS", "GET FOOD",
"SW", "U".  YOU ARE NOW IN FRONT OF A BRIDGE WITH A TROLL GUARDING IT.  THE
ONLY THING THAT WILL CAUSE THE TROLL TO LEAVE IS TO THROW HIM A TREASURE.
THERE IS ONLY ONE TREASURE YOU CAN THROW HIM AND THAT IS THE EGGS.  SO "THROW
EGGS", THEN "CROSS".

YOU ARE NOW ACROSS THE CHASM.  CONTINUE WITH "NE", "E", "NE", "E", "GET
SPICES", "W", "N", (HERE IS THE VOLCANO), "S", "S", "SE", "S", "IN".  YOU ARE
NOW IN A ROOM WITH A FEROCIOUS BEAR, WHO IS LOCKED UP WITH A GOLD CHAIN.  YOU
NEED TO GET THE CHAIN, SO "FEED BEAR", THEN "UNLOCK" THE CHAIN, "GET BEAR",
"GET CHAIN", "DROP KEYS", AND "OUT".  THE BEAR WILL NOW FOLLOW YOU WHEREVER YOU
GO.  SO GO "U", "U", "W", "W", AND "CROSS".  FROM NOWHERE, THE TROLL APPEARS
AGAIN.	JUST "DROP BEAR", AND THE TROLL WILL DISAPPEAR.  NOW "CROSS" THE
BRIDGE, THEN GO "SW", "D", "GET TRIDENT", "SE", "SE", "NE", "E", "N".  YOU ARE
IN THE CLAM ROOM, SO NOW "OPEN CLAM".  (IT IS NECESSARY TO HAVE THE TRIDENT
BEFORE YOU CAN OPEN THE CLAM).	NOW YOU NEED TO GO AFTER THE PEARL SO GO "D",
"D", "GET PEARL".  THEN "U", "U", "S", "U", "E", "U", "N", "LAMP OFF", AND SAY
"PLUGH".  THEN "DROP CHAIN", "DROP PEARL", "DROP TRIDENT", "DROP SPICES".

BACK TO THE CAVE WITH "PLUGH", THEN "LAMP ON", "S", "D", "W", "D", "W", "W",
"W", "W", "D", "CLIMB", "W".  YOU ARE NOW BACK AT THE SPOT WHERE YOU ORIGINALLY
FOUND THE EGGS WHICH YOU THREW TO THE TROLL.  THE REASON YOU THREW THE EGGS WAS
BECAUSE YOU CAN GET THEM BACK AGAIN!  JUST SAY "FEE", "FIE", "FOE", "FOO", AND
THEY MAGICALLY APPEAR!	SO "GET EGGS", THEN "N", "N", "W", "D", "SE", "SE",
"NE", "E", "U", "E", "U", "N", "LAMP OFF", AND "PLUGH".  THEN "DROP EGGS".

NOW ON TO FIND THE LAST TREASURE, THE PIRATE'S CHEST!  GO THERE WITH "PLUGH",
"LAMP ON", "E", "U", "W", "W", "W", "S", "E", "S", "S", "S", "N", "E", "E",
"NW", "GET CHEST", "BACK", "N", "D", "E", "E", "XYZZY".  YOU ARE BACK AT THE
BUILDING, SO "DROP CHEST".  CONGRATULATIONS, YOU NOW HAVE ALL 15 TREASURES!

AT THIS POINT YOU HAVE ONE MORE THING TO ACCOMPLISH BEFORE YOU GO THE THE GRAND
FINALE.  SO SAY "XYZZY", THEN GO "W", "W", "W", "D", "D", "N", "D", "W", "D",
"E", "GET MAGAZINES".  YOUR QUEST IS TO TAKE THE MAGAZINES, AND PLACE THEM JUST
INSIDE WITT'S END.  THIS ACTION IS OFTEN MISSED BY PEOPLE PLAYING THIS GAME,
AND AS A RESULT, THEY DO NOT FINISH THE GAME WITH ALL 350 POINTS AND THE GRAND
MASTER STATUS.	NOW GO "E", THEN "DROP MAGAZINES", AND "BACK".

NOW COMES THE EASY PART, JUST WANDER AROUND THESE PASSAGES, AS YOU NOW HAVE
SOME TIME TO KILL.  THE GAME GIVES YOU A SET NUMBER A MOVES AFTER ALL THE
TREASURES ARE IN THE WELLHOUSE, AND THEN YOU ARE TRANSPORTED TO THE GRAND
FINALE.  THE MESSAGE YOU WILL GET WILL START BY SAYING "THE CAVE IS NOW
CLOSED", ECT.  AT THIS POINT YOU ARE TRANSPORTED TO THE NORTHEAST END OF AN
IMMENSE ROOM.  DO THE FOLLOWING:  "SW", "GET ROD", "NE", "DROP ROD", "SW".
WHAT YOU HAVE DONE IS PLACED A STICK OF DYNAMITE AT THE OPPOSITE END OF THE
ROOM.  NOW YOU SAY THE MAGIC WORD - "BLAST".  YOU HAVE NOW EXPLODED A HOLE IN
THE FAR WALL, AND YOU MARCH THROUGH IT INTO THE MAIN OFFICE.  YOU HAVE NOW
FINISHED THE GAME OF ADVENTURE!

[From] The Grim Eggbert #158           [Subj] BS/2

Hi there.  Allow me to introduce myself.  I was featured in the documentary
t-file "The History of Real K-K00L DOODS" (by The Edge) as a troubled
adolescent with some real serious problems.  However, with a lot of self-
induced shock therapy I've mended my ways.  There's nothing like having your
every character flaw pointed out in excruciating detail to make you step back
and say "Eggbert, you need a change."

Fortunately, those kind, wonderful folks in cDc SAVED MY LIFE!  They took me
under their wing and taught me that with a lot of hard work and cash donations
to their group, I can be a meaningful person!  They're also teaching me how to
be elite!  Once a week they give me a "s00per sekrut mission" which usually
involves the acquisition of hi-tech equipment to further their wonderful plans
they have for the future of us all.  They can't tell me these plans, you
understand, as I am but a cDc/WorkerDrone in the K-K0W F0RCE! and do not need
such information.  When I succeed in returning back to my base with my job
completed they lavish me with praise and Hostess Fruit Pies like no mere
natural parent can!  When I fail (c0w forbid!), they beat me severely and make
me wear women's evening gowns.  I hate the humiliation.  But I deserve it
because it's the only way I will learn to be elite.  Daddy?  Stop it.  I love
you too, cDc.  Please don't hit me again.  Twinkie?  They're having me do a
suicide run on a central office next week so I may not be able to call back. 
Where's Mommy?  Another part of my work for cDc is programming this new
operating system called BS/2.  Thank you sir, may I have another?  I feel so
groggy, and it's getting hard to see.  They  haven't fed me in a few days.  I
am K-K0W F0RCE! and I can handle it!  I'll kill them all.  Daddy?  I love cDc
with all my heart.  What was I saying?  The horror... oh my.  I'm going to put
the info file for BS/2 next in my message so you can see how elite I'm becoming
and be proud of me too.

Here it is:
------------

             cDc introduces the most VIOLENT operating system ever!

  Welcome to a new era.  Welcome to the next generation in operating systems:

                                     BS/2

You're in a hurry, so you want PCs to respond faster.  You do many things at
once and wish your PCs could too.  You want software that's more powerful, but
also easier to use.  You'd like more color.  You're eager for your systems to
communicate with other systems.  You want improved reliability. And you want
all this without obsoleting your investment in equipment, software and
training.

                         Well TOO BAD!  STOP WHINING!

cDc brings you B0VINE SYSTEM/2, the fastest and most gut-wrenchingly powerful
operating system ever!

EUNUCHS, PMS, Mac System x, AmigaDOS, Windoze NT, etc...  don't even think
about it!  Give it up and GO HOME!  We scoff!  HA!  All other operating systems
cower and DELETE THEMSELVES due to their incredible relative lameness!  Check
it out!

    Real multitasking!  Hundreds... even thousands of processes all running
    simultaneously in a non-stop BATTLE to the DEATH!  The eventual winner
    burns itself into an EPROM and REIGNS FOREVER!!

    Over 500,000 levels of HIERARCHAL FILESYSTEM to be explored, complete with
    hundreds of SECRET INVISIBLE FILES!!

    An astounding 3-D GUI!  Windows HURTLE open at BLINDING speeds to display
    cracked glass, piles of oozing gore, and UGLY HAGS who glare at users
    with the EVIL EYE!  The GUI also features a mouse pointer shaped like a
    BLOODY KNIFE!  The scroll bars are covered with MYSTICAL RUNES!  Every
    file has TEN ICONS... but NINE of them are DEADLY TRAPS!!

    AUTOMATIC DISEASE SIMULATION!  Every week, BS/2 will create a new
    VIRUS to PLAGUE your valuable files!  Each new virus is MORE POWERFUL than
    the last!  Don't slack off... with BS/2, DOOM lurks around EVERY CORNER!

    Virtual reality?  OLD NEWS!  BS/2 creates REAL reality with HIGH-SPEED
    SUBLIMINAL MESSAGES that ATTACK and DEVOUR the very MIND of the user!
    The world of BS/2 will become your world too... AND YOU'LL LIKE IT!

------------
Well, do you like it?  Does it make you happy?  It makes me very very happy.
But only if cDc is happy!!  I want to be good.  Would you like me to upload the
beta version?  Please?!

Sincerely,
Eggbert

P.S. What state am I in?  What year is it?
Help me

Subject: Grad school and automatic weapons
Date: 3 Nov 92 19:22:13 GMT

Geek and weapons humor ripped off from DESPERADO.

     It's common knowledge that whenever you get two or more CS grad students
together, the conversation will inevitably drift to the same topic: automatic
weapons.  Lately, we've noticed that whenever we attend a CS party, picnic, or
bull session, we always hear the same questions and discussions, usually from
the younger grad students:

    "I want to mount an M60 in front of the sun roof of my Tercel, but
     the mounting bracket wasn't drilled for import cars.  How did Josh
     Bloch do his?"

    "Some of my friends at the MIT AI Lab don't like M203's because the
     grenade launcher adds too much weight, but I wouldn't have gotten
     out of IJCAI-85 in one piece if it hadn't been for those 40mm flechette
     rounds.  What do you think?"

    "Do you have to be a god-damned tenured professor to get teflon rounds
     at this place?"

    "Does the 'reasonable person principle' cover hosing down a member
     of the Soar project after he's used the phrase 'cognitively plausible'
     fo
    "I used to use Dri-Slide to lube my M16.  How come my advisor says
     Dri-Slide is for momma's boys and Stanford profs?"

    "Does the way Jon Webb keeps flicking the safety of his Mac-10 on
     and off at thesis defenses make you nervous, too?"

     In short, there is a lot of concern in this department for the proper
care, handling and etiquette of automatic weapons.  So as a service to the
department, we are starting a two week daily series on "The Care and Handling
of Your M16A1." Every day for the next two weeks, we will post on the wall
outside our office the day's helpful hint on care and maintenance of that good
old departmental standby: the M16A1.  Our thanks to the US Army, whose
training manuals we have shamelessly cribbed for material.

     We would like to encourage other knowledgeable members of the CS community
to share their expertise in a similar fashion.  There is a real need for this
kind of dialogue in the department.  The new students come in here every fall,
and are totally unequipped to handle the realities of graduate student life at
CMU.  Computability theory and lexical scoping are fine things to know about,
but they just don't cut the mustard when somebody from the Psych department
opens up on you with an Ingram set to full auto.

Subject: Supporting one's opinion with sustained fully automatic weapons fire.

     I had recent occasion to view your Presentation Announcement on care and
feeding of automatic weapons during lecture hall.  I found it most amusing.  I
would very much like to see and/or contribute future material.

     We have similar problems here at Berkeley, though it has been difficult
to wean our students away from more the more mundane assortment of Browning
Hi-Power's, Beretta 92SBF's and Sig-Sauer P226's.  The 9mm clique is pretty
strong here, and the young grad students fairly parsimonious.  They tend to
balk at the idea of spending enough money on ammo to make full auto firefights
practical.  Lately, they've taken to sniping at each other from the Campanille
tower and engaging in loose hit-and-run guerrilla tactics during finals.  This
is obviously not the American Way and needs to be changed.  While I've been
able to slowly wean them into more progressive arms (such as the Beretta 93R
and an occasional mini-uzi), I still can't seem to get past the supply problem.
My questions are:

    "Do you buy your ammo in bulk, or do appointed individuals do shifts on a  
     progressive reloader?"

    "Does the school pay for this?"

                Thank you.

                    Sincerely,

                    J. H.
                    U.C. Berkeley

My reply to J. H. of UC Berkeley:
- - - - -----
J. H. -

     Thank you for your letter.  It was certainly interesting to hear of
conditions out on the West Coast.  What can I tell you about the situation here
at CMU?  I'm really glad I came to CMU.  The faculty is absolutely first rate,
and they all take pride in their weapons skills.  We are admittedly a pretty
opinionated bunch, which provides for many interesting interchanges within the
community.  I, for instance, think the long barrel .44 Automag is more of a
fashion statement than a weapon, though you won't catch me saying that within
earshot of Prof. Fahlman.  If you catch my drift.

     I am very fond of Berkeley.  I think that while LA represents the dark,
twisted climb-the-water-tower-and-start-shooting-until-the-Marines-settle-it
side of California weirdness, Berkeley represents the very best of the pure,
innocent-killer side of it all.  The first weekend I ever spent in Berkeley
was in the summer of 1983.  I was sitting down at one of those really
delightful cafes you have out there.  To my left some old man was drinking
cappucino and practicing Chinese calligraphy; down the street some
undergraduates were engaged in a running firefight.  I was taking it all in,
thinking that Berkeleians have remembered something about living well that the
rest of America seems to have forgotten; when this kid's stray .223 slug
shattered my glass of pomegranate soda.  "Crazy undergraduates" I remember
chuckling to myself as I put the safety back on my Hi-Power and returned it
to its holster.

     It seems a shame that ammunition is so hard to come by out there, though. 
We are quite spoiled here at CMU.  The departmental attitude towards logistical
support really crystallized for me in September of my first year.  One of the
incoming first-year hot-shots had taken out Prof. Felton with a head shot from
500 yards.  We were all really impressed, and I think it was generally agreed
that Felton couldn't have asked for a more painless, appropriate end.  It was a
beautiful, almost poetic way to cap what had been a textbook career of
brilliant, original mathematical insights punctuated with outbursts of random,
deeply unhinged violence.

     You've probably heard of Felton (National Academy of Science, IEEE Past
President, NRA sustaining member).  My advisor told me later that Felton's
academic peak had come at that now-infamous 1982 Symposium on Data Encryption,
when he presented the plaintext of the encrypted challenge message that Rob
Merkin had published earlier that year using his "phonebooth packing" trap-door
algorithm.  According to my advisor, Felton wordlessly walked up to the
chalkboard, wrote down the plaintext, cranked out the multiplies and modulus
operations by hand, and wrote down the result, which was obviously identical to
the encrypted text Merkin had published in CACM.  Then, still without saying a
word, he tossed the chalk over his shoulder, spun around, drew and put a 158
grain semi-wadcutter right between Merkin's eyes.  As the echoes from the shot
reverberated through the room, he stood there, smoke drifting from the muzzle
of his .357 Magnum, and uttered the first words of the entire presentation:
"Any questions?" There was a moment of stunned silence, then the entire
conference hall erupted in wild applause.  God, I wish I'd been there.

     But I digress.  At Felton's funeral, our departmental chairman delivered
the eulogy.  I'll never forget his summation: "Poor Felton.  Published and
published, yet perished just the same." And that's the attitude that the
professors take here.  As my advisor said: "The tragedy of Galois is that he
could have contributed so much
                                                     -Olin

     It came to me suddenly one night... in a Taco Bell... the festering
remains of a beef burrito sulking in my stomach... the concept for  the
ULTIMATE box... yes, the

                             $$$$$$ MONEY-GRIP BOX $$$$$$

               (transcribed from a Mexican-food induced vision by)


     Think about it.  Every "box" ever invented was based pretty much on the
same premise: how to get SOMETHING for NOTHING.  In other words, to RIP OFF. 
Well, taking this concept to its logical conclusion, we end up with a "box"
that simply CREATES MONEY.  Yes, CASH wherever you need it.  Not JUST for phone
calls, but for pizza, cigs, laptops, v.fast modems, parking meter fares, YOU
NAME IT.  YOU DECIDE.  The box... PROVIDES.

     Of course, the electronics required to build this wonder have not been
invented yet, but I will try to explain.  First off, the box must of course be
green.  But not just ANY color of green.  It must be MONEY GREEN.  Maybe even a
picture of George Washington on the back.  As for buttons, there will be just
ONE.  A BIG, GOLD button in the center of the box... labeled "CASH."  And when
pressed, the sound of cash registers will emanate from the unit - "Ka-CHING!"

     I believe the main circuit should be a rectifier... to rectify the
situation in YOUR FAVOR.  Many capacitors (the green, electrolytic type) are to
be arranged in a pattern on the PCB as such:

                         -|C-    -|C-
                         -|C-    -|C-
                -|C- -|C- -|C- -|C- -|C- -|C- -|C-
              -|C-       -|C-    -|C-
                -|C-     -|C-    -|C-
                  -|C- -|C- -|C- -|C- -|C- -|C-
                         -|C-    -|C-        -|C-
                         -|C-    -|C-      -|C-
                 -|C- -|C- -|C- -|C- -|C- -|C-
                         -|C-    -|C-
                         -|C-    -|C-
 
     Using a typical OP-AMP, you should be able to wire these caps to allow you
to amplify your NEED for CASH.  Of course, be sure the entire circuit is
properly grounded.  Otherwise, hundreds of dollars could be sent RUSHING
through your body by accident.

     After combining the rectifier, capacitors, OP-AMP, and proper grounding
wires, you must 'baptize' the PCB with human blood.  Find a small child, take
him out to Chuck-e-Cheeze, and when he's not looking, drain a few pints.  Pour
the blood over the entire circuit.  Take his lunch money while you're at it.

     Next, you need an IC... but not just ANY IC... you need a chip of the
future... a FHSIC chip (Fucking Huge Scale Integrated Circuit).  I can't tell
you exactly the specs on this baby, since my vision was interrupted at this
point by a hearty black-olive-flavored belch, thereby jerking me out of my
divine insight.  I'll get back to you all on this one.

     Once you get the FHSIC, just slap it in the box on top of the PCB.  It's
an INTELLIGENT chip, so ya don't have to worry about pinouts and all that crap.
 t'll know how to connect itself.

     As for POWER SUPPLY, there's an ironic twist here.  Note the following
equations:

          Time = Money
         Money = Power

     Ergo, Time = Power!

                         (Note: all units are metric)

     Since MONEY is POWER, and TIME is MONEY, well, the box will drain power
from the TIME CONTINUUM itself... and the translation of that TIME into MONEY
will be seamless.  Equations don't lie.

     Add the solid gold button (SPST switch) and a speaker (for the
"Ka-CHING").  Close the box, and secure it all with generous portions of CLEAR
EPOXY.  Use GOBS.

     NOW.the fun part... go to a payphone... place a direct call to Guam.  When
the operator asks for money; close your eyes, push the gold button and chant,
"Mo' money, MO' MONEY, Mo' money".  Concentrate on your NEED for $$ (coupling
to the OP-AMP circuit) and you will suddenly hear the "Ka-CHING" and smell
burning flesh.

     Hovering six inches in front of your face should now be EXACTLY the amount
of $$ you need (in the proper denominations, of course) to complete your call. 

     Do this same procedure in ALL circumstances where you need money.  Just be
sure to be out of sight (the appearance of floating cash tends to freak out
ordinary people).  The box will ALWAYS generate EXACTLY the amount you need.
If you happen to get MORE money than you THINK you need, you were WRONG.  The
box, since it gets its power from TIME, can predict the future to an extent...
and may generate $$ that you will need in the NEAR FUTURE$$
you need immediately.  Do not be afraid.  The box knows!

     That's about it.  Future plans for foreign currency are bouncing in my
head:
              Germany - "Der MoneyGrip Box"
              France  - "Le MoneyGrip Box"

And so on....

     Now, BUILD IT... and bask in your glory.  Ta-dah.

  ..oooOO Count Zero OOooo..=RDT

HEY COW BEAT!
     I just wanted to write and tell you and your readers about cool, talented

                                             Omega fan in New York

Dear Omega Fan,
     Lucky you!  Omega reportedly gets some 2000 letters a week from

DEAR COW BEAT,
     Hi!  I am 12 years old and my name is Nicole.  I love your mag.  COW BEAT
is so informative!  There is one thing I would like to know.  What is Lady
Carolin going to do now that she's written "Earth Goo?"  Will she write
more files?
                                             Nicole S.
                                             Colorado Springs, CO

Dear Nicole,
     Now that she's finished "Earth Goo" and her files have spread far and
wide across the planet, Lady Carolin has been doing what any superstar who's
just completed such a file would do - rest!  Even while resting, Lady Carolin
has been thinking about new files and you'll get to read her new material which
is due out sometime in 1993!

DEAR COW BEAT,
     I have dandruff in my eyebrows.  I've tried dandruff shampoos, but they
haven't worked.  How can I handle this?

                                             San Diego, CA

Dear Jennifer,
     What you're looking for is SANDPAPER.  'nuff said.

DEAR COW BEAT,
     I love Tequila Willy so, so, so much!  To give you a brief idea of my
feelings - I had a special sweatshirt made with Willsie's name on it, I created
my own Willsie earrings and every time I make pancakes, they spell out Tequila
Willy!  My teacher even calls me Willsie!  I hope someday I can meet Tequila
Willy and the rest of the Willsie family.
                                             Debbie K.
                                             Glendale, AZ

Dear Debbie,
     Great!  That's the spirit!  Now, build a shrine.

DEAR COW BEAT,
     I'm a 28-year-old guy, and recently I have begun stealing birth control
pills and eating them.  They give me the weirdest feeling.  I'm beginning to
think I'm addicted.  Is there something wrong with me?

                                             Terra Haute, IN

Dear Todd,
     Man, that's pretty creepy.  Maybe you shouldn't be eating those things?! 
Yeesh....

--

DEAR COW BEAT,
     I go wild whenever I see cDc files and this drives my family crazy!  One
time, my mom caught me kissing printouts of your files; I was mortified!  I
thought my face would be permanently red!  Remember that I love all of you and
please, please, please come to Topeka soon!
                                             Kimberly H.
                                             Topeka, KA

Dear Kimberly,
     A dozen of us are planning a visit soon, and we'll be staying at YOUR
house!  Love ya, babe!  xoxoxo

DEAR COW BEAT,
     I'm in the 7th grade and there's this guy at school I like and he seems to
like me too, but once he said he didn't.  My friends say that he really does
like me, but that he's too shy to admit it.  I would at least like to be able
to talk to him like I do all my other friends.  My problem is that i'm too shy
around him and I cant seem to start up a conversation with him to give our
friendship a chance.  How can I start a conversation without being so nervous
and shy?  This way, we could start some sort of relationship.
                                             Chrissy M.
                                             Austin, TX

Dear Chrissy,
     Chrissy, Chrissy Chrissy.  SILLY GIRL!  Offer him some Kool-Aid and let
nature take its course.  Then try some lines from Three's Company, it'll floor
him.  Next....

DEAR COW BEAT,
     I'm head over heals in love with The Pusher who wrote "Silent Applause."
He's soo cute!  Last night, I dreamed we went on a date to the beach.  He
kissed me and asked me to be his girlfriend.  Oooh!  It was awesome and soo
romantic!  My goal is to REALLY be his girlfriend.  Pusher, if you're reading
this, thanks for giving me such sweet dreams!
                                             Pam N.
                                             Tampa, FL

Dear Pam,
     We sent your letter over to The Pusher, and he said he was going to have a
really SPECIAL dream about you, too!  Lucky Pam!

DEAR COW BEAT,
     I'm 12 years old and I have a big problem.  There's this one girl in my
class who thinks I'm a snot.  This girl says mean things about me to my
friends.  Another thing is that ever since I got my hair cut, everybody seems
to hate me!  Anyway, I don't know this girl that well, but I'd really like to
be friends with her.  Help!
                                             Mike T.
                                             Durango, CO

Dear Mike,
     She thinks you're a snot?  I don't see the problem.  Maybe you lack
resolve.  Don't just let her think you're a snot, make sure she KNOWS you're a
snot.  Ah, youth.

DEAR COW BEAT,
     First of all, I'd like to say you're doing an excellent job of keeping me
informed on all the hot stars of telecom.  I'd appreciate it greatly if you'd
please put a picture of this gorgeous, fine, and not to mention sexy, guy
Franken Gibe in your magazine.  His eyes are to die for!  Thanx!

DEAR COW BEAT,
     I am an eighteen-year-old high school senior and my older sister Tracy is
my disciplinarian.  Tracy is seven years older than me, and I have been living
with her for the last two years while my parents are on a foreign-work
assignment.  My sister is a Registered Nurse and treats me very well, but she
feels she has every right to warm my tail, as she calls it, if I disobey her or
misbehave.  She doesn't give me a strapping, thank goodness, but her pretty
hand or hairbrush does plenty of justice to my bare behind.  If I misbehave,
she will not hesitate to turn me over her knee, lower my pants and briefs, and
very severely spank my bare butt.  It stings badly too.
     The spankings stings, but the embarrassment of  being over he knee with my
bare behind sticking up is worse.  She frequently has her nurse's uniform on,
so when she puts me over her knee, my genitals cannot avoid rubbing on her
stockings.  It's erotic, to say the least, and it's hard to control myself.

                                             Steve L.
                                             Cherry Hill, NJ

Dear Steve,
     Wow.  That's very special.  Thanks for sharing.

DEAR COW BEAT,
     What's up?  My name is Jenny and I am 12 years old.  I love cDc!  I have
394 posters and 42 pins of them.  I love Drunkfux.  I have 220 posters of him
alone.  My best friend, Michelle, has 394 posters too.  She loves Swamp Ratte'.
She cries and faints over Ratte' like I do over Drunkfux.  I love your nose,
Drunkfux, and also about 25 to 30 other things about you.  Michelle loves
Ratte's legs, and about 20 to 25 things about him.  We love cDc.  I love love
love you!  You're the best thing that ever happened to us!

DEAR COW BEAT,
     Hi!  My name is Nicky and I'm 10 years old.  I like your magazine very
much, especially the Letters section.  I truly love Obscure Images.  He is my

I hate New Kids On The Block, but I LOVE cDc!!

The COW BEAT News Pasture!

     Last time Cultee COUNT ZERO made an appearance at a mall in Florida, 24
fans were injured due to their wild youthful lust.  When he appeared at a
Washington mall, he had to escape in a laundry hamper!  More recently,
thousands of screaming fans turned up at the Cambridgeside Galleria in
Cambridge and the Atrium Mall in Chestnut Hill in Massachusetts to get a
glimpse of their idols; COUNT ZERO, THE DETH VEGETABLE, DAVE FERRET, and WHITE
KNIGHT.  This time around, the gals kept their wits about them and there were
very few injuries reported.
     Before the Cultees arrived at the Atrium Mall, radio DJ Bob Casta reminded
the 5000-plus crowd to make sure they didn't push and shove in their excite-
ment.  There were people on the main mall floor and even more people looking
down over the railings three levels high!  At the Galleria, THE DETH VEGETABLE
and DAVE FERRET arrived on a police jet ski at the Cambridgeside Lagoon.  The
gals started chanting "FERRET!  FERRET!  FERRET!"  Pretty soon, hunky WHITE
KNIGHT and COUNT ZERO arrived too - by helicopter!
     VEGGIE scanned the crowd and pointed to all the posters of himself and
other Cultees.  "Next time, instead of buying those, give that money to the
homeless people of Boston," said VEGGIE with a sweet smile.  "They're the ones
who need it.  And please be careful and watch out for each other on the way
out."  What caring superstars they are!

--

     Okay, you work really hard to be successful, staying up until all hours of
the night writing files, modding your board, persuading the public you've
got what it takes, and then - boom - you're a sensation!  Journalists
peg you for interviews and gals everywhere quiver in your presence.  Add lots
of coffee and drooping pants to this picture and you've got G.A. ELLSWORTH!
     Every morning, girls wait for him to come out of his house just so they
can touch him!  Girls hand him love notes, phone numbers, cards, flowers and
other goodies.  And, of course, G.A. loves it.  What guy wouldn't love all that
attention?!  But, he says, "It doesn't boost my ego.  I'm just glad they like
my work."

--

Responding to allegations concerning their reputation as the GANGSTAZ of
TELECOM, an anonymous cDc spokesperson responds: "Sure, we'd bust caps on a
narc... but we don't support killin' nobody that don't deserve it!"

--

The cDc CULTEES love mixing in with their fans, but due to their overwhelming
popularity, that can sometimes be dangerous.  You know how you are, girls.  If
you saw a CULTEE standing near you, wouldn't you go absolutely nuts?  Sure you
would!!  So, THE NIGHTSTALKER and THE RAVER devised a clever way to mix with
their fans and be perfectly safe at the same time!  All they do is slip into
some wigs, sunglasses and girls' clothes and they can walk right through the
crowds!  Leave it to cDc to find an ingenious solution to ANY problem!

  ______________________________/advertisement\_______________________________


     If you were to bottle the vibe and aura that is CULT OF THE DEAD COW, what
would it smell like?

     Just like cDc, the scent would have to be fresh, innovative, charming,
cool and totally versatile.

     Kind of like your fave piece of clothing (be it a black jacket or a pair
of jeans) that you can dress-up or dress-down and wear anywhere and everywhere!

     So, back to our original question:

                      What would cDc smell like in a bottle?

     cDc experimented in its secret underground labs and didn't stop until it
had achieved perfection, capturing the flash of cDc as well as the subtleties.

     cDc proudly introduces its newest fragrance - PISS!

     This lively scent mirrors the chic, sophisticated technophile lifestyle of
today's active cyberpunk.  If your nose is twitching with anticipation, look
for cDc's PISS! at fine stores everywhere.

     A totally unsolicited quote: "All I gotta do is dab on a little of cDc's
PISS! before I go out... and man, the hotties come runnin'!  Thanks, cDc!"
                                             -DISPATER, Phrack magazine


                                    cDc's PISS!

                               Fresh!  Now!  Wow!

                    Creating memories to cherish.  You and cDc!


  _/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/


COW BEAT VITAL NOTEZ: RACER X, who is very often trailed by hordes of fans when
he's out in public, says he feels like "the Pied Piper." GREENPEACE, a
glamorous member of cDc, the hottest group in telecom, says he honestly can't
understand why people want his autograph!  TARKIN DARKLIGHTER says, "There's no
more just walking down the street, and going somewhere and hanging out with
people.  But it's the price you pay."  RED KNIGHT's fave type of gal?  "An
understanding, sweet, charming girl with a strong personality!"  REID FLEMMING
is a guy who's always in the public eye.  Whether he's attending some gala
event, doing some publicity, going out to dinner, or even just hanging out -
people are constantly looking at him for fashion do's and don't's.  What's
REID's advice?  "Stay away from pastels.  That's about it."  Thanks, REID!

Well, that's the end of this SLAMMIN' issue of COW BEAT!  Be sure and watch
for the next DOPE edition, with the 411 on all your FAVE telecom HUNKSTERS!

                        Encyclopedia Brown Does It Again!
                                by Andrew Solberg


     It was raining again, and from the safety of his garage Encyclopedia Brown
frowned at the precipitation. "Who's going to visit our detective business in
this weather?" he fumed.
 
     Sally had to agree.  She was the prettiest girl in their grade, and was
also the toughest.  Many was the time that Bugs Meany regretted ever having
crossed Sally in one of her cases.  Encyclopedia was the brains behind their
operation, possessing the keen memory and sharp mental skills that his nickname
implied, but Sally was the muscle; bullies had learned to steer clear of the
pair when they were on a job.

     Suddenly, Pee-Wee Weatherby ran up the driveway.  Soaked to the skin, the
pudgy second-grader approached the overturned wooden crate that served as the
agency's desk and plunked down a scratched-up quarter.  "I've got a job for
you," he declared firmly.

     Encyclopedia pocketed the quarter.  "No case too small," he announced.
"What's the scoop, Pee-Wee?"

     "That bad old Bugs Meany has sold a bunch of us on a plan to recycle
newspapers.  We were all to contribute a dollar to get the business started.
Bugs said that we could earn $2.50 a week once the plan got underway.  Well,
it's been two weeks now, and we haven't seen any of our money!  We asked Bugs
to give us our stakes back, but he said he couldn't do that.  I want my dollar
back!"

     Sally patted Pee-Wee across the desk.  "Don't worry, Pee-Wee.  The
Encyclopedia Brown Detective Agency is on the job!"

     "That's right, Sally," said Encyclopedia.  "Now, Pee-Wee, can you tell us
where Bugs is hanging out?"

     Soon the rain stopped, and the trio biked over to the abandoned lot on
Jefferson Street.  A pile of scrap metal and boards formed a ramshackle
club-house.  Hanging on the door was a crudely-lettered sign reading:

                                  PAPER RECYCLING
                           NEWSPRINT, CARDBOARD, SCRAP
                                    CASH PAID

     Below it was another sign reading:

                          CLOSED UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE

     Lounging in front of the clubhouse was a very bored-looking Bugs Meany. 
He was an older boy with a Jughead crown hat and a nasty sneer.  He hated
Encyclopedia Brown for his interference in his previous schemes, but he feared
Sally and her terrible fists.  As the three kids approached, Bugs looked a
little nervous.  However, he soon relaxed and looked down his nose at the
younger children.

     "Welcome to my place of business, ladies and gentlemen!" Bugs announced in
a sarcastic voice.  "Would you like to trade in your newspapers for cash?  Gee,
I'm really sorry, but our business folded, and I don't know when we'll be back
on our feet."  He regarded the trio with a saucy smile.

     "You dirty rat!" shouted Sally.  "You're robbing kids of their money for
your business and not giving them anything in return!  I'll bet you never did
one minute of work at recycling!"  Sally menaced Bugs with her fists; Bugs
quickly recoiled.

     Encyclopedia Brown surveyed the yard.  The grass had grown very tall and
green.  Next to the clubhouse was a wheelbarrow, partially filled with old
newspapers.  There were several ruts cutting across the abandoned lot.  They
were all of uniform depth.

     Bugs was shouting back at Sally: "That's not true!  I had a legitimate
business going!  I would bring newspapers, cardboard boxes, and other paper
scrap to the recycling center!  They paid me cash; I was going to distribute
it to my shareholders as soon as I showed a profit!  I invested their stake in
that wheelbarrow, but then the recycling center closed!  Now I can't repay the
stake; otherwise I would - honest!"  He favored Sally with a smug smile.

     Encyclopedia Brown stepped up to Bugs and picked something off his shirt. 
He held it up for all to see.  It looked like a scrap of greenish ribbon.
Encyclopedia Brown smiled.

     Bugs Meany frowned.  "So what?  What does that prove?  It doesn't mean
anything.  I'm innocent, and you can't prove otherwise."

     "You're wrong," said Encyclopedia quietly.  "You're guilty, and you're
going to return that money right now.  You see, Bugs, you made one small
mistake."

                             WHAT WAS BUGS' MISTAKE?
                                   (see below)


     Bugs' mistake was meeting the Brown Detective Agency alone.

     Sally held Bugs down and sodomized him with a power drill.  By the time
she had worked her way up to the three-eighths-inch bit, Bugs was in a
talkative mood.  Encyclopedia Brown elicited the appropriate confession and
obtained a full refund for the other kids.  Sometimes, not having a shred of
evidence is no obstacle for a real sleuth.

Encyclopedia Brown does it again!

-----------------------------------------------------------

IRC MANUAL FOR LOVE V. 2.0 (corrects a few bugs, and adds new features)

    Written by Steve Franklin, 11:02, July 22, 1992

How to succeed with love and flirting on irc:

Be a girl.

Start a channel called #hotsexforpervertswhoare10inchersormore.

/msg guys who have names like hugeone, manly, bigbody, or worse.

Figure out exactly what your dimensions should be...

Don't remind the fellow you are flirting with that he is actually a geek.

NEVER ask the question "if you're so great, being so smart, incredibly good
looking, a sports jock, and piano virtuoso (THOR!), then how come you're on
irc 18 hours a day?"

Become one with irc lingo - this inclu

     I'm getting an erection but I can't deal with that now.  I've got cereal
to eat.  BEFORE IT GETS SOGGY.

     Right.  So I try to take my mind off Miss Gibson's perkily heaving
mammaries and move my attention back to my not-just-for-breakfast-anymore food
product.  My cereal, you ask?  Alpha Bits.  Choice of py00ter geeks everywhere.
 Alpha Bits cereal consists of little brown wheat-things shaped like the
numbers 0 through 9, and these small marshmallows in the shape of letters A
through F.  Hexadecimal, ya know?  A lot of cyberpunks are into this thing
called Marshmallow HEX now, made from these Alpha Bits marshmallows which are
laced with a stimulant and hallucinogen.  It sounds kinda like ice, but doesn't
turn you into a raging psychopath.  It's more of an "enthused trip," sorta.

     Anyhow, there are bunches o' t-files out on making Marshmallow HEX so I
won't go into it here.  On the back of the cereal box are hex and ASCII charts
so the kiddies can get off by spelling obscene words in their bowls in hex.
It's a great way to start your day.  Hey hey.  I should get paid for the rhymes
I've made.  Another reason why Alpha Bits is so popular amongst py00ter types,
as is Special K, is that it's fortified... with Vitamin K.  Vitamin K is
important to keep you k-rad and out of that lamerosity slump that can drag you
down.  Yeah, a well-balanced breakfast is important and never let it be said
that I skimp on nutrition, including the full day's supply of Vitamin K I get
with my Alpha Bits.  Just ask any other elite types and they'll tell you too...
Vitamin K is the way to start out a totally elite day.  Let me rephrase that:
"vITAmiN K! iZ ThA waYYE t0 stARtEZz 0UT A t0tALlye EL8! dAY!!!!1!"

     I've gotta keep my k-ness up 'cause I don't want any shit coming down on
me from DemonSeed Elite.  If you still don't know the deal with DemonSeed
Elite, then listen up.  People don't like to talk about him/it much, 'cause
it's such a heavy subject... like a giant cow hanging over your head, ready to
drop at any slip up you make.  Or in this case, a monster truck.

     Rumor is, that back in the late 1970s-early '80s, DSE was a user who
achieved Maximum K-rad Eliteness at which point his soul merged with the global
telecom network.  DemonSeed Elite was no longer just a person, but an entity
residing in the cables and satellite links of the network.  He is AT&T, he is
Internet, he is SouthWestern Bell, he is Smilin' Uncle Dudley's Child Pokin'
BBS across town.  He is your phone.  He is the spy satellites which orbit above
our heads.  He knows when you've been sleeping and he knows when you're awake.
And he takes any sign of lameness on his networks as a personal insult.
To speak his real name is to die.  Lamers and r0dents all face his wrath.
No one has seen him dealing out his vengeance, or been alive afterwards to tell
about it, but it will come.  Believe that.

     All we can do is make assumptions from the wretched remains.  A thirteen-
year-old with his intestines ripped out; fiberoptic cables twisted tightly
around the pulp of what was once his frontal lobe.  The young geek's forehead
was branded "k-lame", the words still sizzling in his freshly seared flesh when
he was found bleeding to death on the floor of his bedroom.  His monitor still
glowed with the ominous text, "C U L8R!", upon signing off to his friend he had
been chatting with over the modem.  His pal suffered a similar fate.

     Entire user groups have been found at their meetings hung from the rafters
with coaxial cable, their bodies swollen and blue as they swung gently in the
hushed roar of the air conditioning system.

     DemonSeed Elite, in his physical manifestation, is said to prefer
travelling in a giant orange monster truck with tires 30 feet high and 30 feet
wide.  The accuracy of these monster truck descriptions may leave something to
be desired since the witnesses were pissing their pants at the time of
observance... though the monster truck theory is consistent with some reports
of death.  On several occasions, groups of r0dents were found squashed flat as
they crossed a parking lot or open field.  The only clue to the cause of their
sudden flatness was giant tread marks all over their bodies.  It's as if a
large truck fell from the sky and crushed them into a 2-D state, then
disappeared!

     Now you can believe this, take heed, and watch out for yourself or not.
Hey, it's your life.  But as for me, I'm gonna get on with eating my Alpha
Bits.  I'm no fool.  No siree.

                             "Live From XmasCon 1991"

     This file was created at the second annual HoHoCon during the night of
December 28th through to the next morning in Houston, Texas.  A laptop computer
with a text editor was passed around the rooms and out in the hallway where a
dozen or so mostly wasted con people sat on the floor brainstorming and the
following file is the result.  Fourteen major telecom guys contributed to this
file which probably makes it a first as a group effort file not written over a
network.  It's almost entirely raw and unedited to try and get the spirit of
the HoHoCon across with all the spelling mistakes and lack of punctuation
intact.  I know I speak for everyone there who travelled some pretty long
distances in saying that we had a great time.  Heaps o' thanks to Drunkfux and
everyone else who organized the event, we appreciate it.  My comments will be
in double brackets ([[]]).

DCypher: Scot's a nice, he's a great guy, but don't leave him alone with your
daughter and a box cutter.

<Switching to Chris Goggans of MOD.>

CDeath: How long have you been programming in Unix?

DCypher: Bruce Sterling introduced me into programming Unix. I was fascinated
to learn that there were no people at the SS who knew how to program in Unix.

CDeath: Chris, what's in the future for MOD?

CG: Soap on a rope.

CDeath: Any closing comments?

DCypher: Watch your ass around coredumps. Tell your friends to leave the room
when you feel an 8 or 9 megger coming on.

CG: It's time for some more water.

DCypher: I look forward to more Matrix Coredump.  Experience the cyberfuture.

Omar: Gunnar!

[[Joke explanation: Drunkfux resembles the Nelson twins 'cause of his long
straight blonde hair.  Gunnar is the name of one of the Nelsons.  Get?  Got.]]

Bruce Sterling: Who stole my Unix programming manual?

World View Staff: Nobody, Bruce.  You left it in the Cyberspace Matrix.

Count Zero: Chow down on some cyber-snackage....  Ruffles have cyber-ridges.

Judge Dredd: Terminal Illness is my cyber-friend.

Dispater: Call Speed Cyberwaste Elite / World H.q  1000's of Viruses and Dust

Steve (lawyer): ...and let's talk now about CIVIL LIBERTIES!

Crimson Death: Cyberwaste -- The only BBS with 5 gigs of monster truck gifs,

Doc Cypher: I'm sorry but those dancers were 2 of the ugliest beasts I've ever
seen in my life.

Lord MacDuff: Ho Ho Ho's.

G.A. Ellsworth: Smells like Teen Spirit...

New Prophile... Erik Bloodaxe.

Chris, what did you think of those rad dancers?

Erik Bloodaxe: Made me wish I had charged up my cattle prod.

Doc Cypher: I wish I brought my box cutter personally.

Arch Angel: Did I see a fat girl dancing on the table?  With huge porcupine
tits sagging?  She was going, 'Hey big boy!@!!!.'

Swamp Ratte': I gave one of them money when they were done, and they didn't
even have to squirm all over me.  I'm such a nice guy.

Erik Bloodaxe: I'm a lot more entertained now, Omar.  About 3 hours ago I was
a lot less entertained. 

Doc Cypher: There's a bunch of drug crazed lemmings out there!

Hunter: Ok, give me credit for getting the titty girls...  Say my board is the
k-raddest in Houston.  Who's got drugs, the strippers' hamster wants to O.D.

Erik Bloodaxe: Well, gee, I've gotta piss... there's probably some traces
(of drugs) in there if they want them.  What exactly is this masterpiece you've
been working on?  Blackmail... that's what it is!

Count Zero: I've died and gone to Hell.  I'm sitting in a hotel room where
the maid never comes and I'm listening to disco.

Arch Angel: I took a serious coredump today... didn't take too much processing.

Lord MacDuff to Arch A.: It was obvious you had a couple of beers last night.

Holistic Hacker: So,Omar... what did you think of those bAbeolOusous dAnzurZ?

Drunkfux was the hit with the good looking ones... chicks dig Nelson.  If
Dispater hadn't paid them, they'd all be sucking his dick right now.

Arch Angel: Hey... the fat one knocked over the radio.

We were at least going to be economical about it....  I had it down to 10
people for 3 hits of acid... in Gunnar's suite.

Lord Macduff: THIS lasted for 2 hours?

Arch Angel: It looked like the Wizard of Oz here... with all the fingers
pointing.

We were talking about Alpha Bits with Hex Marshmallows... and on the back
you've got a hex-ascii converter.

Count Zero: Demonseed is everywhere, yet nowhere...it is everything, yet
nothing, but maybe just a bunch of little things....

Something that even virtually reality could entice..or even begin to describe
this fiasco of cyber whores from the matrix that have been beckenforthed..

Doc Cypher: Hey, we've started a new group.  Kult of the Dead K0dez.

Swamp Ratte': Yeah, kDk.  We're so elite, we know everything there is to know
about everything, so we sit around talking about butterflies and rainbows.
It's beautiful, man.  Rad as rad can be.  Wave o' the future.

Holistic Hacker: Just remember... this is not your father's HoHoCon.

4:44am - Omar lost his mind.  DemonSeed woke up and gained more power.

<Drunkfux>..(wait a second..I wrote all that 2!!!1!!)

Drunkfux: I feel the need for a song. abstract, of course.

------------------------------------------------

Tawk tawk tawking bout sum cyber stuff
Like Demon Roach's new Monster Truck sub
Matrix hoppin we will go
In search of the hex marshmallow
Come now, come now, do not pace
We're off to call cyberwaste
The new beast known as demon seed
Run over your head and make you bleed
Decryption of the message I soon will start
For I have the hex-ascii chart
Fat, skanky dancers running all around
Wonder how many STD's Dispater has now
What made me sick was the one's hairy mole
Did I mention that Omar looks like Cliff Stoll
Bruce taught me how to program in Unix and Hack C
Omar had his picture taken with E.T.
This is it.. I must go..
I may finish later.. I don't know

-------------------------------------------------

The Summoning of Demon Seed...

Blackness was all around in the Hilton parking lot... the power was strong and
we knew Demon Seed Elite might appear any second from the power of pre-puberty
crazed glangular overactive k0dez kids... a hush fell over the parking lot and
we suddenly felt irritated for some reason -- yes we knew that tonite WAS the
nite for the coming of Demon Seed Elite.

A herd of K0dez kids wandered by in search of K-rad cyber-strippers.  In a
flash of blue light and clouds of 10 micron dust motes, Demon Seed Elite
materialized.  It's blazing CGA monitors flashing with menace, it descended on
the nerdlings with fury....

The beams shot forth from the blazing monitors searing the flesh of the huddled
masses.  The first casualty was a gangly young codester, twitchintg with the
expectations of the looming nudity.  The firey beams struck him at the base of
his spine, ripping flesh from bone, sending a shower of blood over the
remainaing hacking horde.  The energy expuled from the first kill powered on
the energy seeking transformer of Demon Seed.  The k0dez kids cried out in
escatsy knowing that cheezy motel porn was no more in their bloodthirst for fat
sleezy cybernetic whores.  They had a bigger thing to worry about right now -
it is Demon Seed Elite.

As the k-rad K00L smoke cleared, Demon Seed Elite appeared...again...  The
drolls of the M0D special issue cybernetic cotton gin's drolls permeated the
cybernetic battlefield...with dung...cybernetic dung: the dung of the
Demon Seed.

The thousands of pixels which made the eye of the Cyberwaste cast its watchful
gaze on the terrain some 6,700,000 miles below, methodologically scanning the
payphones of the known universe for the brief flash of a KaLl1Ng KaRD!!11!1!

Yet we have not taken the time to discuss the true meaning of Demon Seed, for
he has the untmost pirating cabilities... Demon Seed needs no ratio or time
limit for everyone knows the k-rad warez of the future that sp00geD out of the
bed of Demon Seed... for he has the power to travel into the future and get
games that have yet to be created in our present time...

Then the EELYTE surviors beheld to our surprise and delight
Clifford Stoll himself sat in the passenger seat, cluthing a pipe
His hands were all shaking, just like a speed freak
He spit when he laughed, and we called him a geek
"It's the COOKIES!" he exclaimed, "Not the speed or the blow"
"Don't end up like me!  Please, just say no!"
The truck rattled and shook, the license plate read "K-K00L"
As it drove away, all we could do was sit, gape, and drool.

     "Though government certainly uses technology to oppress, the evil lies not
in the tools but in the wielder of the tools.  In fact, technology represents
one of the most promising avenues available for re-capturing our freedoms from
those who have stolen them.  By its very nature, it favors the adaptable (who
are quick to see the merit of the new, over the sluggish (who cling to time-
tested ways).  And what two better words are there to describe government
bureaucracy than 'dull' and 'sluggish'?"

     "Risks, an internet mailing list, reported about a week ago on a proposal
by Dr. Dorothy Denning, one of the most prominent people in the field of
cryptography, that copies of all private encryption keys associated with public
key cryptographic systems be held, effectively by the government, to permit
them to read people's encrypted messages to each other.
     Many have noted that the dawning of cheap and effective cryptographic
systems could spell the end of the ability of governments to invade people's
privacy. Unfortunately, it appears that the government and its cronies have
also realized this, and intend to take preemptive action. Our notion of civil
rights has decayed so far that it is now considered a citizen's duty to not
merely be quiet while he is enslaved but to actively cooperate with his own
enslavement. Not merely must we put up with the indignity of the government
being granted the right to read our papers and communications to each other,
but now it is suggested that we ordinary citizens must personally cooperate to
make it easier for them to read our communications."

     "One passage from the Pledge of Allegiance struck me as a youth as being
the true strength of my government.  This passage requires me to protect my
country and the Constitution for which it stands from all enemies, both foreign
and domestic.
     I think those who would give too much power to the government have not
said their pledge in a long time.  It says that my country is fully behind the
aims of the Constitution and that I as a member of that country have been given
the duty to disolve the government by force if reguired when the government
becomes an enemy of the people who enacted the Constitution.  Implicit in
that duty is the call to those aims without regard to the laws the errant
government may have enacted or protections removed.
     To those ends my government is not allowed to prevent me from meeting
with others who may feel that the government has gone bad.  I am allowed to
keep my COMMUNICATIONS private.  In order to defend my country from a bad
government as well as other threats I am allowed to keep and bear arms.
     To the end of individual protection of the right to privacy, the
individual must secure that privacy through any means available.  The
government must not prevent the individual from using encryption to secure
their right to privacy.
     Because my government is an extension of the people of my country, when
my government starts protecting itself from those very same people it must have
placed the government above the Constitution and the will of the people. 
Suggestions like requiring the registration of encryption keys speak to how
close some parts of the US government have come to being for itself and not for
the people."

Here's something VERY interesting for everyone in cDc!!  Today I got a phone
call (on my board line, I picked it up) from someone who wouldn't identify
himself.  He started by saying that I was in major trouble.  I was wondering
who it was, and then he finally mentioned cDc and he said that he and the
association he's with ("... extremely underground, you will never be able to
find us") is against the "sick trash that your group puts out, and it is
insulting" or some shit like that.  Then he continued, "We do not like the fact
that your members are sympathetic to certain people."  I started going into
this long statement about freedom of speech, and then he started threatening
everyone.  He said that he could shut us down within 48 hours and that anyone
who didn't drop out was in major trouble, including their families.  So I
asked, how do you expect to do that?  He said they have "very high connections"
or something.  He wouldn't tell me who he was, he only said that he has a shell
account on DRU and that many people use it often.

NEWS RELEASE                          Immediate 3/18/92

PEDOPHILIA, COMPUTERS AND CHILDREN

     If you have children in your home and a home computer complete with a
telephone modum, you [sic] child is in potential danger of coming in contact
with deviate and dangerous criminals.
     Using the computer modum [sic], these unsavory individuals can communicate
directly with your child without your knowledge.  Just as importantly, you
should be concerned if your child has a friendship with other youth who have
access to this equipment in an unsupervised environment.
     Using a computer and a modum your child can readily access community
"bulletin boards" and receive sexually explicit and graphic material from total
strangers who can converse with your children, individuals you quite probably
wouldn't even talk with.
     The concern becomes more poignant when stated otherwise; would you let a
child molester, murderder, convicted criminal into your home to meet alone with
your child?
     According to Fresno Police Detective Frank Clark, "Your child can be in
real danger from pedophiles, rapists, satanic cultists and other criminals
known to be actively engaged in computer conversation.  Unwittingly, naive
children with a natural curiosity can be victimized; emerging healthy sexual
feelings of a child can be subverted into a twisted unnatural fetish affecting
youth during a vulnerable time in their lives."
     "It is anticipated that parents, when armed with knowledge this activity
exists and awareness that encounters with such deviate individuals results in
emotional and psychological damage to their child, will take appropriate
measures to eliminate the possibility of strangers interacting with their
children via a computer."
     A news conference is scheduled for 10 a.m., Thursday, March 19, 1992 at
Fresno Police Department, Headquarters.  The conference, presided over by
Detective Frank Clark, will be held in the Library located on the second floor.

                                 I must laugh.
                            I laugh a nervous laugh.

                             Surburban Fascist Regime
                                  by Matt Welsh

     Recently I had an article published about me in the Journal of the
Daughters of the American Revolution, entirely about my experiences back in the
Army.  One of the main points that was stressed over and over in a grueling
series of interviews, cross-examinations, questionnaires, and photography
sessions was the fact that I lost my taste buds from shrapnel back in 'Nam, and
have ever since been unable to discern the piquancy of anything I eat.  Texture
and the U.S.R.D.A. nutritional information on the sides of cereal boxes is now
my single rationale for choosing one entree or side order over another, and
for some unknown reason this fact is infinitely engrossing to the swarm of
media personnel that pay daily visits to explore my history and background.
I'll eat sea squirt, mashed potatoes, and orange jello all in one large bowl,
hashed together, to impress upon them my utter and complete lack of taste.
Lucky Charms and tequila is a favorite morning snack of mine.  The apparent
dangers of this kind of obliviousness are being slipped a mickey in my drink
or even getting my steak a bit underdone.  To avoid such pitfalls I bring along
my hunchback Porcopio to taste all my dishes before I myself partake.

     Porcopio is a brave and noble man, and doubles as my bodyguard whenever
Jim's not around with his phalanx of ninjas.  The last time I had any kind of
trouble was in an alley behind the movie theater one Tuesday night as the early
showing of the most recent Disney movie was just letting out.  A pack of three
or four slovenly burgeoning juveniles accosted Jim and I as we were making off
with the life-size cardboard cutout of Crocodile Dundee from the theater's
lobby.  Fortunately the ninjas were on-hand as always and in a flash of
shuriken, katana, and bare-fisted flurry the adolescents were in retreat,
nursing their superficial wounds and cursing the ancestors of the silent
warriors.  What could we do but bow, take them all out for sandwiches at Jack
In The Box and bid their honorable selves adieu?

     At a loss, Jim and I eventually ended up back at my place where, inspired
by the death stalkers of the night, we sat down and played head-to-head Tetris
on his Nintendo and ordered out for Smelt Egg sushi handrolls.

                            FOR A MOMENT HE SMILED
                             by Tequila Willy/cDc

     They spotted Randall long before he spotted them.

     "He looks like a good one!" Scott shouted.

     "Yeah, not scrawny like that last one!" Steve laughed.

     Randall stood motionless, paralyzed with fear.  Who were these men and
what did they want from him?  He glanced at Malcolm and Charlotte who only
exchanged confused glances.

     Seconds seemed like hours in the silence of the morning air.

     Suddenly Scott produced an axe from his backpack and, pointing straight at
Randall, said, "We're taking you home with us!" Steve laughed in agreement.

     Randall felt the axe tear into his side.  His life blood mixed with the
freshly fallen snow and a scream escaped from within his being.

     Malcolm and Charlotte gasped in horror at the sight before them.

     "What was that?" Steve asked.

     "What was what?"

     "Must've been my 'magination."

     Scott drew the axe back over his shoulder and resumed bludgeoning
Randall's body.

     Malcolm and Charlotte stood motionless, not sure what to do.  Their
lifelong friend was being struck down, just a couple of yards away from them,
and they were powerless to help.

     The men labored with their grisly mission for several minutes, taking
turns with the axe.  Sweat dripped from their foreheads and coated their
armpits.  When it was all over, Randall was a pitiful disembodied wreck in the
snow.

     Scott, now smiling, glanced at Malcolm and Charlotte and wiped Randall's
juices from the axe.  This final insult sent a mixture of anger and fear though
them.

     Steve tied a rope around Randall's body and began to drag him away from
the scene.  Scott returned the axe into his backpack and walked a few yards
behind Steve.  As if their casual murder wasn't enough, they both began to sing
as they disappeared into the distance.

     Malcolm and Charlotte began to cry.

     Randall slipped in and out of consciousness for the next few weeks.  He
was hardy for his size, and though his wounds were mortal, the life blood
within him was enough to drag out his final days on earth into the greatest
living hell and beyond.

     He remembered the wind rushing around him shortly after being subdued.
And the sounds of a truck engine running.

     He remembered being tortured with a saw.

     He remembered being tarred and feathered, in a strange sort of way.  And
he was secured in a manner which kept him motionless.

     He remembered the countless fires they lit in the weeks that followed.
The countless fires that were placed so dangerously close to him that he could
feel the heat wanting to consume him - and at that point he would have welcomed
it.

     He remembered the way the men brought over all their friends who laughed
and pointed at him.  They sang mocking songs at him that made him cry.

     He remembered the way they finally cleansed him of the tar and feathers.

     He remembered being placed in the cold dark street to finally die.  The
weeks of torture had finally ended.

     And he lay there, in the cold dark morning air.  He felt so dry and
lonely.

     He thought about his friends back in the forest and for a moment he
smiled.

-/-\-/-\-/-\-/-\-/-\-/-\-/-\-/-\-/-\-/-\-/-\-/-\-/-\-/-\-/-\-/-\-/-\-/-\-/-\-
               I hope you have a new respect for the Randall in
                      your living room this holiday year.

[From] The LEGO Maniac #83             [Subj] Donna

Why would we have thought that Donna was going to have sex with David?  It
would be out of character for her, in addition to suggesting to the viewers to
face it that there really is no way a man and a woman can have a romantic
relationship without sex.  If the show did do that, then it would definitely be
predictable since that's what we're constantly told by the shows we watch on TV
(fiction and non-fiction).

[From] Phreakazoid #110                [Subj] Re:Donna

It seemed to me like she was feeling a temptation from her own body and from
David's coercion, and the show attempted to portray her reactions and responses
to that tempation.  I agree that the episode made it seem like it might happen,
because it might have happened to someone who was in the same situation as
Donna but dealt with it differently than she did.

I WAS AT WORK, LOOKING THROUGH MY
WALLET.
I FOUND A PICTURE OF YOU.
I HELD ONTO IT TILL MY BREAK
THEN
I...
TORE IT A FEW TIMES
WENT TO THE RESTROOM
THERE WERE 3 URINALS
(1 WAS OUT OF ORDER)
I DROPPED YOUR EYES AND NOSE AND EARS
INTO ONE URINAL
AND I DROPPED YOUR HAIR, NECK
AND CHIN (AND THAT HIDEOUS
MAROON SWEATER) IN ANOTHER.
I DROPPED YOUR MOUTH IN THE CRAPPER.
THEN I LAUGHED AS I PISSED ON YOUR EYES
ON YOUR EYES AND NOSE AND EARS
I DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO SHIT ON YOUR MOUTH
BUT I AM SURE SOMEONE HAS BY NOW.

Calvin - I wish I had more friends, but people are such jerks.  If you can just
         get most people to ignore you and leave you alone, you're doing good.
         If you can find even one person you really like, you're lucky.  And if
         that person can also stand you, you're really lucky.

Hobbes - What if you find someone you can talk to while you eat apples on a
         bright Fall morning?

Calvin - Well, yeah... I suppose there's no point in getting greedy, is there?

[From] Mathew Hennessy #129            [Subj] and another thing:

     I am so unhip it hurts.  I see so many hip people around here, with that
hip, sullen expression, wearing their hip, black, sullen clothes, carrying
their oh so hip portfolios around hiply, yet sullen.  Their self-induced
tension is so thick even I can see it.  I am held in thrall by their powerful
sense of self-persecution.  I can't look away as they discuss their hip
problems amongst their own dark and moody clique.  The clouds of hip tobacco
smoke rise from their corner table where they talk about other people's art and
make assumptions even though the person who actually poured out his/her soul
into the canvas could hardly have known it would be such an icon to these hip
persons.  I can't help feeling envious of their self-induced tension, and their
hip black leather shoes with a gloss and a shine unrivalled by the slickest oil
spill.  Those art chicks really turn me on with their fluorescent-lighted
pallor cultivated by many evenings of attending avant-garde poetry readings and
sullen performance art.  And to think I am so unhip I could never in a million
years understand the pain, the TRAUMA, the utter ANGST that these poor, godlike
souls have to contend with.  Nay, my simple life is one of pleasure as compared
to these martyrs, flagellating themselves so sullenly to keep themselves in
enough pain to admire other people's art.  And I am so unhip as to be simply
depressed, not quite hip enough to be as sullen as them.

Sull
/IIIIIII\       Give me SLACK or give me food (or kill me).

[From] Terminal Illness #58            [Subj] My sekrut fantasy

  I'll drop by YOUR MOM's place for our session.  She pays me my $500,000 and
we get to work.

  I tie YOUR MOTHER up, naked and spread-eagled across two sawhorses with
chains. Then I pour STP motor oil across her fat, flaccid butt.  Her pale skin
glistening in the dim light of the garage door opener's bulb makes her seem
even more diseased and pathetic.  "Please, Raheem" her middle-aged mouth moans
in anticipation.  "I had to sell the house and the cars.  I also sold my
husband into slavery, he's now in Botswana.  Satisfy me."

  "Yeah, whatever" I mumble back.  I find a pair of jumper cables under some
badminton rackets and open the minivan's hood which is also in the garage.
I connect the positive and negative cables to the battery and the other ends to
each butt cheek and start the minivan.  YOUR MOTHER is starting to make a
buzzing noise as her teeth rattle together (in ecstasy, no doubt).  Then I take
the tetherball pole which was leaning against the corner and approach her from
behind.  "H-h-how's THIS?!" I try to stutter above YOUR MOTHER's electrically-
induced noises as I shove several feet of the tetherball pole into her vaginal
orifice and far beyond.  Her screams are clearly audible over the purr of the
engine.  All of the noise is getting obnoxious, and besides, the closed garage
is filling up with carbon monoxide.  "Well, s'later!" I say cheerily as I leave
the garage into the house, closing the door carefully behind me.  On my way
out, I stop by the kitchen and make myself a sandwich and help myself to some
Coke.

[From] Swamp Ratte' #102               [Subj] Operation Sundevil III

Yow... really scary dream tonight, 'bout people getting killed and stuff like
this:

I was messing around with my 'puter, calling stuff.  I notice a weird system or
whatever and buffer it all and save the buffer.  Later, I call the weird thing
some more and do whatever... but I start feeling kinda itchy in my head.  Duh. 
Details are really sketchy now, especially from the first part of the dream, so
bear, huh....

So I go visit this hacker friend who lives in a great big, mostly empty house.
It's kinda Victorian style... the guy's sick and laying in bed.  I ask him
how's he doing, and about this computer I found... and he's like, "Damn....it's
got me... it's too late... but you're like <this> caught (and he makes a kinda
pinching motion with his hand, with his thumb and first finger almost
together).  See, that stuff you found, it's a virus, and an AI, but it's more
than that...it'll fuck you up, man...it'll fuck you up."

Then he turns his head to look right at me and he's got these crazy eyes, and
he's sweating, and he starts doing this insane laugh... like an evil clown or
something.  So I'm like, "Uh, yeah... thanks" and split quick.

So for the next few days I'm messing with this stuff I've found... trying to
disassemble it, digging through the file with a sector editor, whatever... and
I can't really figure it out but there's references to bad stuff... like the
Black Death in the medieval period, huge wars, religious slaughters like the
Crusades and the Inquisitions and pagan killing...

So there's all this bizarre stuff, right... and my head's buzzing.  It's kinda
like an ear-ringing thing, but more obnoxious and in the back of my head.  It's
getting worse and I don't know what to do 'bout it... so I go to visit the
hacker guy again.

He's gotten worse.  He's sweating really bad and barely coherent in his speech,
and very weak.  I tell him about the buzzing and what I'd found in the 'puter
file, and he mumbles, "I know... all that... but it's got you too now." and
then he does that crazy laughter... but it turns into seizures, and he's
gasping and all.  So I rush outta the house to mine, pick up the phone and call
'911'...

"911, May I help you?"

"Yeah... Phred P00dutz at 1313 Mockingbird Lane is having seizures and needs an
ambulance!"

"<crazy laughter...> WE'LL GET HIM AND WE'LL GET YOU AND WE'LL GET ALL THE
REST!"... then more of that damn laughter.  The phone starts blaring a really
loud carrier tone... "CONNECT!  CONNECT!"... I'm getting hyper-wigged and slam
down the phone.  My sister's standing there, wondering what's going on... I try
to explain that that hacker guy's dying or dead and there's this 'puter deal
that has something to do with it.  So we're rushing around trying to decide
what to do... and we hear this banging noise outside...like somebody pounding
on a board with a hammer.  It's coming from the front, so we rush to the door
and pull it open.  There's a wooden sign, about a foot and a half long, hanging
from the porch overhang by two chains.  It's swinging slightly, and it has the
words "GOT YOU" carved into it and painted nicely, like some sort of twisted
Pennsylvania Dutch thing.  We're going "shit..." and my sister goes to get the
disk and printouts with the stuff on it, figuring we could just trash 'em or
something and it'll go away.  Then there's the banging noise again, out front.

Rush to the door again, and there's another sign hanging below the first, by
two chains, swinging slightly and carved.  It says "YOUR PARENTS ARE DEAD"

So we go upstairs and there they are, slumped in the corner with their throats
bleeding all over the place... the throats are cut almost completely through
with a single cut.

Yikes.

So my sister and I rush out the door, delirious and freaked out of our minds...
she's carrying the 'puter stuff and we're running out in the front yard to get
away... away to anywhere, we don't know.  But there's the banging noise
again... bambambambambam... and she's stopping and saying "Look at this..." and
the stack of printouts has stuff carved into it, all the way through... and
she's reading it, "Whatsdis...'YOU TOO..." and she falls over and starts
screaming and gurgling... and I'm trying to hold her up but her throat...it's
getting cut through slowly as I stare in blank horror... like a wire was going
right through her neck from the front.

Then I woke up.

"Debbie Does Olivia"
"Debbie, Olivia, and Dawn"
"Gibson on a Hot Tin Roof"
"The Shaggy O.N.J."

at least it will send a message to all those liberal Zionists who have taken
over our country from us Whites.  Faggots are gay because God hates them and
wants them to live a life of filth and cock-sucking.  I kill all of them I
find, after fucking them up the ass first (To punish them of course!  Even the
ones that aren't so cute!!!).  I've killed 58 so far.  Everyone is slime but
me!  I can sea it in George "liberal pansy" Bush's eyes... HE WANTS TO FUCK
BLACK WOMEN!!  BLACK WOMEN WITH LARGE BUTTOCKS!!  BLACK WOMEN WITH SUCCULENT
CHOCOLATE THIGHS AND SOFT INVITING BREASTS!!  And I see that same look in
Bucannon's face too, the way his lip trembles when he sees that black press
correspondant walk in the room with her skirt split halfway up her thigh.... 
She with her silk blouse, and her nipples which point in the stiff breeze, the
way her breasts bounce ever-so-slightly when she leans forward to ask a
question.  DAMN!  IT'S TOO MUCH FOR ONE ARYAN TO TAKE!  Those faggot
Republicans want them!  They all do!  So does Barbara!  SHE TOO KNOWS THE JOYS
OF AN AFRICAN WOMAN!!
Every Wednesday afternoon, the checkout girl at the grocery store, she tells
me, "Have a nice day!"  And I know she wants to feel a REAL ARYAN MAN inside of
her, to experience the caucasian loving I can provide!  SHE WANTS A VANILLA
SHAKE, AND BABY, I'VE GOT IT!!!!

<< If this was a regular board, I'd have a divider here >>

Hello again, Bunny F00-F00.  Clarence.  What did you think of that?

>My eyes!  Argh!  It's horrible!  Please, make it stop!!

Ok, no more.  All those users have something in common.  Do you know what it
is?

>They're all... stupid?

Yes, yes, of course.  But they're also DEAD.  I killed them.  Tonight.  Just
like I killed more r0dents the night before and the night before that.  I call
them to this board so they can make a Final Post.  A lasting testament to their
lameosity.  A death certificate.  I'm DemonSeed Elite.

>No!  It can't be!  I'd heard the rumors, but I never thought they...you...
were real!  I don't understand, why did you call me?  NO!  It can't be!  I'm
elite!  Right?!  I thought I was elite!  Everyone says so!  I'm a warez
distributor!  I've got a fast modem and a big hard drive!  You can't possibly
want to kill ME!

Sorry, Clarence.  It's true.  You've been running with a bad crowd, those warez
d00dez.  I've been watching you, Clarence, and tonight you committed a horrible
sin.  Tonight you... this is hard for me to say, I'm getting choked up...
RECKLESSLY DELETED T-FILES WITH A WILDCARD CHARACTER!  Clarence, how could you?
How could you have so little regard for the sanctity of text files?  Don't you
realize that t-files form the only real, legitimate testimony of our telecom
culture?  The one that WE built ourselves with the roar of our modems and the
callouses on our fingertips?  No outsider can capture this on... on PAPER!
We have text that is beautiful... text that squirms and leaps and trudges
across our screens, vibrant and alive!

>Oh DemonSeed Elite, forgive me!  I was blinded... BLINDED BY WAREZ!!

Buck up, Clarence.  You have a lot to learn on your path to Enlightened
Eliteness.  There's nothing wrong with wares, in moderation.  We must keep in
mind always the proper priorities.  Cherish deeply the Phrack's, the Anarchy
Inc.'s, and the cDc's of our world; for they know the correct path and will not
deceive you.

>I will!  I see it now... everything's so clear!  Thank you... you've saved my
life!

Spared your life.  I'm giving you another chance, but I'm watching.  I'm always
watching.  Log off and go to sleep now, little one.  Tomorrow is a new day.

NO CARRIER

 ______________________________________________________________________________

     The next morning, bells rang out.
 _______  __________________________________________________________________
/ _   _ \|Demon Roach Un  It started out as just another Saturday.  April 26, 1986.  John R.
MacDougall, 25, spent the day alone at his satellite TV dealership in Ocala,
Florida, waiting for customers who never came.  "It was," he says, "a normal
day in the doldrums of the satellite TV industry." But that night, MacDougall,
5 feet 11, 225 pounds, and prone to nervously running his fingers through his
reddish blond hair and adjusting his glasses, would transform into Captain
Midnight and set the world of satellite television spinning.

  Business had been flat since January 15, when Home Box Office became the
first pay TV service to scramble its signal full time.  Other services were
following HBO's lead.  Dish owners were balking at the cost of descramblers and
program fees.  Potential customers were confused and stayed away in droves.The
1985 boom in dish sales had simply petered out, and MacDougall Electronics, in
business for just two-and-a-half years, had seen its early profits disappear.

  American Dream

  MacDougall had stopped advertising and turned off his air-conditioner to save
money.  With no customers, he idled away the day watching TV and reading
magazines.  Later, he would say, "I have been watching the great American dream
slip from my grasp."

  To make ends meet, MacDougall spent his evenings moonlighting as a part-time
operations engineer at Central Florida Teleport, a local company that uplinks
services to satellites.  He was a natural electronics engineer.  A good
student, he had spent his spare time during his teenage years tinkering with CB
radios and automobiles.  With some pals, he rebuilt a 1923 Ford roadster that
he still owns.  He had dropped out of a management engineering course at
Worcester Polytechnical Institute in Massachusetts after two years, but his
first job was installing satellite TV dishes."My father used to tell me I would
need to get a job where I would be able to make money by watching TV just
because I liked TV so much," he says.  At Central Florida Teleport, he could do
just that.  At 4 p.m.  on that Saturday, MacDougall shut up shop.  He stopped
at his home, where he lived alone, picked up a sandwich for supper, and then
reported to the teleport.  After two hours, a second engineer went off duty and
MacDougall was alone in the small building that is flanked on one side by five
large satellite dishes.

  As the end of his shift drew near, MacDougall was absently watching Pee-Wee's
Big Adventure, a movie he was uplinking for the now-defunct pay-per-view
service, People's Choice.  But something else was on his mind.  When the film
ended, MacDougall went through the normal routine.  Before logging off, he set
up color bars and punched buttons to swing the giant 30 foot dish he'd been
using to its resting place.  That was necessary because the soil beneath the
dish's cement pad is sandy clay.  Rainfall could throw it off-kilter, but by
setting it in a certain way the rain runs harmlessly into a gutter.  At its
resting place, the dish points directly at the satellite Galaxy 1.
Transpondedr 23 on that satellite carries the eastern feed of HBO.  "That's
when I decided to do it,"says MacDougall.  "It wasn't like I thought about it,
'Yes.  No.  Yes.  No.' It was just, 'Yeah!'" He scrolled up a character
generator, and electronic keyboard that puts letters across the TV screen, and
tried to think what to write.  "I didn't know exactly how to start it," he
says.  "I wrote 'Goodevening." I wanted to be polite.  I didn't want it to be
vulgar or call them names or anything.  That's not my style."

  He spent a couple of minutes composing his message.  The idea of using the
name Captain Midnight, he says, "just popped into my mind." He had recently
seen a movie with that title about a teenager who had a pirate radio station in
his van.  Now HBO was airing the Sean Penn and Timothy Hutton espionage movie,
The Falcon and the Snowman.  It was at 12:32 a.m.  Sunday, April 27, that John
R.  MacDougall pushed the transmit button on his console and turned into
Captain Midnight.  "That's when I hit it," he says.  "It was almost like an
out-of-body experience.  It was like I was there but I wasn't really there."

  For 4 1/2 minutes, HBO viewers in the eastern United States saw this message:

                            GOODEVENING HBO
                            FROM CAPTAIN MIDNIGHT
                            $12.95/MONTH?
                            NO WAY!
                            (SHOWTIME/MOVIE CHANNEL BEWARE)

  A week earlier, MacDougall had successfully overridden HBO's powerful signal
momentarily with just a test pattern.  (He now publicly denies this, but he
admitted it to a United States attorney.) The network had quickly brushed that
signal aside, attributing it to not uncommon accidental interference.  This
time, the engineer on duty at HBO's Long Island, New York, uplink station
simply stepped up the signal's power.  HBO was transmitting at 125 watts.  When
Captain Midnight applied more power, the HBO engineer revved up to match it.
"He saw the interference and saw that he was losing a grip on things," says
George Dillon, an engineer who investigated the episode for the enforcement and
investigative division of the Federal Communications Commission.  "This little
game took 60 to 90 seconds.  You had these two people at their respective
stations fighting for control."

  As Captain Midnight's signal surged, HBO placed a frantic call to Hughes
Communications Inc., which owns Galaxy 1, asking:  "Is there something wrong
with the bird?" Says Dillon, "HBO thought it might cause damage to the
satellite, so they gave it up.

                    NEVER LOST CONTROL

  In Ocala, Captain Midnight was stunned.  "I could see my signal on top of
HBO's as soon as I hit the transmit button," says MacDougall.  "I stared at the
monitor for a while, and then I didn't know if it was two minutes or 10
minutes." Caught up with engineering curiosity, he monitored power levels and
downlink signals.  "At no time," he says, "did I lose control over the
transponder." But then, as suddenly as he had struck, he quit.  "When I shut it
off, I really didn't know how long I had been on top of HBO, but that's when I
started to feel very guilty," he says.  "I thought, "Ohmigod, what did I do?'
That thought raced through my mind for the next 10 or 15 minutes as I
reconfigured the teleport back to normal.  The guilt really set in that night.
I didn't sleep very well."

  On Sunday morning he woke up to the same nagging doubts.  "I thought maybe I
should turn myself in.  But then I thought, 'Well, let's be rational.  Nobody's
going to see it.  Nobody cares.  HBO will know.  They'll get the message.
They'll reconsider their arbitrary and unfair pricing, and maybe I'll read
about it in a few months in Satellite Orbit.  That's basically how I
rationalized, not panicking, and went on with my daily routine that Sunday.'

  Then he saw that Captain Midnight's HBO ambush was making TV's network
newscasts, and he began to panic.  "I was devastated and so nervous with
frustration.  I had to work that night at the teleport.  Another man was going
to be there for the first two hours.  When he got there I had to pretend and
say things like, "Dkid you see this guy Captain Midnight?  Geez, do you realize
what in the world, he could have done?' That was difficult."

  Normally, MacDougall's natural curiosity would have made him the first to
want to discuss how it was done.  But as the event made national headlines and
became fodder for jokes by David Letterman and Johnny Carson, he went the other
way, trying to play it down.  The tension grew as HBO clamored for his head,
and the FCC and even Congress got involved.

  On April 28, HBO chairman Michael J.  Fuchs wrote to the FCC saying that the
company had received calls threatening to move Galaxy 1 into a new orbit.  He
urged the Commission to "use all its investigative resources" to capture
Captain Midnight.

  "This wasn't just a jamming, but a jamming and replacement.  And a
fascinating one at that," says HBO spokesman Alan Levy.  "That's why you saw a
lot of action on this case.  We understand that the dish owners are at odds
with the programmers, but when you escalate it to this point, it gets a little
wild and woolly.  And when you're breaking the satellite system of the United
States, it's very serious."

  FCC investigator Dillon says the implications of the incident involved a
threat to the national security.  "There's lots of highly sensitive data
involved.  If you have a bandit, it could disrupt the business of the United
States--things like defense communications, medical information, telephone
communications, and teleconferences.

  Edgar Eagan, owner of Central Florida Teleport, took the incident very
seriously.  "He logged out and signed the log and decided to stay and play,"
says Eagan, founder and past president of ESPN, the sports network.  "In
reality he was using the equipment for an unauthorized and illegal purpose."

                      RUMORS GALORE

  As the investigation proceeded, rumors abounded.  Satellite TV publications
and television commentators received calls and tapes from people claiming to be
Captain Midnight.  The FBI was said to be on the case, and the hunt was rumored
to focus on Dallas, Texas.

  In Ocala, MacDougall had decided to "play it dumb." Discreetly, he talked to
colleagues in the satellite TV business to find out how the investigation was
going.  But gradually he could not resist discussing the incident with other
engineers and operators who talked about what happens when two signals meet on
a single transponder.  He was outraged when they dismissed his observations.

  "I don't like to say this, but even the more skilled personnel were of the
assumption that you would never get a clear signal with two signals feeding on
the same channel," MacDougall says.  "I brought out the fact that if one was
much stronger than the other, it would override it.  At that point they told me
I was wrong, and that I didn't know what I was talking about.

  "All of my life people have never taken my word for things because I've
always seemed to be a little younger than they are, and maybe a little less
experienced, but I've always come up with the right answer.  They didn't seem
to believe my theory.  Well, I guess they ought to believe it now, because I
was right."

                        THE TIP OFF

  It was a phone call made by a disgruntled dish owner from Ocala that
concentrated the FCC's investigation on the Central Florida Teleport.  Someone
claiming to be Captain Midnight was overheard by a tourist from Wisconsin at a
phone booth just off Interstate 75 in Gainesville, Florida.  The tourist
reported the conversation and the man's license plate number to the FCC.
MacDougall says the impostor was a customer of his, but he doesn't know his
last name.  Again, he was outraged.  "He was very militant about scrambling and
the cable progra business, and not tried to make out like some kind of hero, I
would still be panicking and wondering whether they were going to come and get
me."

  MacDougall's voice rises as he exclaims, "I still can't believe this guy
actually told people he was Captain Midnight and MacDougall says the only time
he broke the law was driving over the 55 mph speed limit.  "I never even bought
beer under age.  I was a model citizen," he says earnestly.

                     FCC MOVES IN

  In July, FCC investigators talked to MacDougall, asking questions that led
him to believe they knew what had happened.  He told them he hadn't done it,
and that he had no knowledge of the incident, but then he really began to
worry.  "I was very concerned about it, but I didn't let on," he says.  "I'm
able to hide my feelings very well.  I can just about convince people I'm a
total raving maniac at the same time."

  Two weeks later, the FCC returned.  This time, they brought along U.S.
Attorney Lawrence Gentile III, who served MacDougall with a subpoena to appear
in U.S.  District Court in Jacksonville.  According to MacDougall, their
conversation went like this:

  "What's this for?" MacDougall asked when Gentile held out the subpoena.

  "Captain Midnight," answered Gentile.  "Aren't you aware that you're a
suspect in this incident?"

  "You're trying to tell me that just because I'm a satellite dish dealer and I
happened to work for a teleport, I'm a suspect?  responded MacDougall.

  "There are other things," replied Gentile.

  "Well, what are they?" asked MacDougall.

  "We can't discuss it here," said Gentile.  "We can talk about it in front of
the grand jury.  You need to think very carefully about this.  You seem like a
level-headed man, but you don't seem to be taking this seriously.  This is a
serious time.  You might want to consult with an attorney."

  "Attorney for what?" questioned MacDougall.  "I haven't done anything.  An
innocent man does not need an attorney.  The only people who hire attorneys are
guilty people."

  According to MacDougall, Gentile then attempted to reach an agreement with
him.  "If you would be willing to talk to us about this and tell us what you
know about this incident right now," said Gentile, "I'd be willing to recommend
probation to the judge and a small fine.  Probation and a fine are not bad
considering what you're facing.  Let's face it, Mr.  MacDougall, this is not
the crime of the century.  However, we have been getting a lot of pressure on
this."

  MacDougall said at that point he began to think there was not enough evidence
to convict him; otherwise he wouldn't have been offered a plea bargain.  Still
claiming innocence, MacDougall told Gentile he would see him in Jacksonville.

  MacDougall's first brief jamming raid on HBO led investigators to strongly
suspect him.  The investigation had been narrowed down to uplink stations with
the capacity to pull off both raids, and then to those manned by the same
person at the time of each incident.  "We had a very good idea he was our man,"
says Gentile.  "Of all the people I talked with, he was the only one I gave
target warnings to [the equivalent of the Miranda warnings police give when
they make an arrest].  "He says he leaned on MacDougall "pretty hard."

  MEET CAPTAIN MIDNIGHT

  Taking Gentile's advice, MacDougall contacted an Ocala attorney, John Green
Jr.  When they first met, MacDougall recalls, "he said, 'Well, John, tell me
about Captain Midnight.' And I reached out my hand and said, 'Well, here,
that's me.'"

  Green advised him that he had a 70-percent chance of winning the case.  If
convicted, he faced a $100,000 fine and/or one year in jail.  But MacDougall
decided to enter a plea of guilty.  "There were two reasons," he said.  "I
could release my guilt, plead guilty, and get it over with, do the right thing.
That kept panging at me:  do the right thing.  But the other side, the
activist, kept saying, 'Stand up for your rights.' My idealism and my activism
were combating my conservative upbringing and my conservative political
leanings.  They were battling back and forth, and I was at my wits' end.  I
didn't know what to do."

  MacDougall also worried about going before the grand jury and trying to lie
his way out of the charge.  "I would not have wanted to take a midemeanor and
make it a felony by committing perjury," he says.  In the end, the determining
factor was money.  Green advised his client that going to trial could take 6 to
12 months and cost $30,000 to $40,000.  "During that time," MacDougall says, "I
couldn't have said anything, and I would have been bombarded by the press.  It
would have been a nightmare."

  Fighting and then losing the case was always a possibility, and MacDougall
conjured up nightmares of what that might entail.  "This was a federal
penitentiary they could have sent me to," he said.  "The concept just didn't
register, to be sitting eating lunch with the other convicts in striped
uniforms, and a guy says, 'Hey, what are you in for?" And I say, 'Oh, I
operated a trnsmitter without a license.' I couldn't take the risk."

                      FUN EDUCATION

  By the time he went to the federal court on July 22 and went through the
arrest procedure, which included being photographed and fingerprinted,
MacDougall's curiosity was back in full force.  "If I hadn't been directly
involved, it probably would have been a fun educational experience," he says.
"You can't just plead guilty to a crime.  It's hours and hours of discussion,
and you have to prove to the prosecutor, and also the judge, that you are
guilty.  Then, you have to prove you weren't coerced into making the statement,
and that you have knowledge of your rights." MacDougall says officials at both
the July 22 hearing and the sentencing, on August 26, were surprisingly
cordial.  He speaks of smiles, handshakes from marshals, and understanding from
U.S.  Magistrate Howard T.  Snyder, who fined him $5,000 and placed him on one
year's probation.  "I'm glad to see that the legal system does work," he says.

  Meanwhile, although convicted in court, MacDougall had become a hero to many
dish owners and satellite TV dealers.  A group calling itself the Captain
Midnight Grassroots Coalition had formed and was selling bumper stickers,
T-shirts, visors, and sweat bands to raise money for MacDougall's legal costs.
Said Donald Cochran, spokesman for the coalition:  "While there are those who
consider Captain Midnight a criminal for his unauthorized transmissions, there
is another group made up of home satellite dish owners, small business people,
and rebels, who support his actions as a non-violent and non-destructive
protest in the best American tradition."

                     THE RIGHT REASONS

  MacDougall says he has had no direct involvement with the coalition, but he
adds, "I would like to see my own industry support me in this.  Even though I
may have done more harm than good, as some people think, I did it for the right
reasons."

  Central Florida Teleport owner Eagan, on the other hand, says that local
opinion in Ocala and surrounding Marion County has gotten "silly." When the
coalition presented MacDougall with its first donation, a check for $500, in
September, a crowd gathered outside his office, and drivers of passing cars and
pickup trucks honked their horns.  Says Eagan, "There's a group of people here
who think that John MacDougall is a wonderful man and a great hero who has done
wonderful things for them.  But to me, that has not been placed in the
perspective of the world view or even the regional view.  Ninety-nine and nine
tenths [percent] of the people don't agree."

  Eagan says the only positive thing to come out of the incident was that
MacDougall was in the home dish business and so there was at least a reason for
him to have done it.  "If it had been some crackpot who did it just for the
hell of it, or an employee being vindictive, then the corporate community would
have been more upset.  This way they can say, 'We're not the target, HBO was.'"

  Still, the FCC is stepping up security.  It has moved to require that by the
end of 1987 every radio and television transmitter must use an electronic name
tag whenever it is on the air.  Each satellite uplink station would leave a
unique, unchangeable electronic signature whenever it was used.  Also, a bill
is being drafted in Congress that would raise the penalty for satellite
interference to a $250,000 fine and/or 10 years in jail.

                    SCRAMBLING A REALITY

  HBO's Levy says that now that scrambling is a reality, he believes consumers
are dropping their emotional resistance to it.  "We were the first ones to
scramble," he says.  "We got the arrows in the back and we were the ones to get
jammed.  We're over the first hurdle.  HBO wants its products in every home in
America.  We are attempting to increase our business through home dish owners.
We're calling for the marketplace to set the price.  It wouldn't make sense for
HBO to stifle its growth.

  MacDougall says he never contested the right of HBO and other programmers to
make a profit from their programs, nor did he object to their right to protect
those profits by scrambling signals.  "My real concern is that the free and
competitive marketplace be allowed to operate for the benefit of the American
people," he says.  Now, he believes that the last line of Captain Midnight's
message [Showtime/Movie Channel Beware!] was misunderstood and got him into a
lot of trouble.  "It was a bad choice of words on my part," he says.  "I was
just trying to tell them:  "Look before you leap.  Don't follow HBO as the
leader.'"

  It was, he says, the act of a frustrated individual who was trying to get his
point across to people who didn't seem to listen.  He hopes no one will try to
imitate what he did:  "The message is now out; there's no reason to do it
again."

  MacDougall was born in Elmhurst, Illinois, just outside Chicago.  His mother,
Thelma is a homemaker, and his father, Robert, was a successful building
contractor, who retired when MacDougall was 9.  The youngest of three brothers
and one sister, MacDougall moved to Florida with his family shortly after his
father's retirement at the age of 47.  MacDougall speaks often of his father.
Although his entire family supported him after the HBO incident, he says, "My
father is of the old school, a very staunch conservative:  the law is the law,
and it should never be broken."

                     WAS IT WORTH IT?

  MacDougall says he doesn't know now if playing Captain Midnight was worth it
all:  "I might be able to better answer that in a couple of months." He intends
to write a book about the incident and plans to continue holding on with his
satellite TV business in Ocala.  He says that like many small businessmen, he
didn't start off with enough money, although he did turn a profit in his first
year.  "I'm losing money now and a good businessman doesn't lose money," he
admits.  "I didn't buy expensive food.  I bought cheap gas for my car.  I cut
everything I could and I'm still losing.  Now, I can barely plan a month ahead
because of the volatile changes in the business.  You never know what's going
to happen the next day."

  MacDougall believes in himself, although he says he's not a great salesman.
He lost his job at the Central Florida Teleport before he was revealed as
Captain Midnight, because People's Choice went off the air.  But all the
publicity has resulted in more repair business from dish owners, and he says
manufacturers return his calls quicker now.  "There's a certain pride that goes
into my systems," he says.  "I sell a part of myself with each system."

  For all his public declarations of regret, there is also an undeniable pride
in having pulled off the notorious HBO raid.  "Did I know it would work?" asks
Captain Midnight.

                      "DEFINITELY!"

Suggestions welcome. 



------------------ The Code of the Geeks v1.0.1 --------------------------
----------------------     July 17, 1993    ------------------------------ 

So you think you are a geek, eh?  The first step is to admit to yourself
your geekiness.  No matter what anyone says, geeks are people too; geeks
have rights.  So take a deep breath and announce to the world that you are a
geek.  Your courage will give you strength that will last you forever.

How to tell the world you are a geek, you ask?  Use the universal Geek code. 
By joining the geek organization, you have license to use this special code
that will allow you to let other un-closeted geeks know who you are in a
simple, codified statement.

The single best way to announce your geekhood is to add your geek code to
signature file and announce it far and wide.  But be careful, you may give
other geeks the courage to come out of the closet.  You might want to hang
on to your copy of the code in order to help them along.

---------------------
INSTRUCTIONS:

The geek code consists of several categories.  Each category is labeled with
a letter and some qualifiers.  Go through each category and determine which
set of qualifiers best describes you in that category.  By stringing all of
these 'codes' together, you are able to construct your overall geek code. 
It is this single line of code that will inform other geeks the world over
of what a great geek you actually are.

Some of the qualifiers will very probably not match with you exactly. 
Simply choose that qualifier that MOST CLOSELY matches you.  Also, some
activities described in a specific qualifier you may not engage in, while you
do engage in others.  Each description of each qualifier describes the wide
range of activities that apply, so as long as you match with one, you can
probably use that qualifier.

----------------------

VARIABLES:
Geeks can seldom be quantified.  To facilitate the fact that within any
one category the geek may not be able determine a specific category,
variables have been designed to allow this range to be included.

        @       for variable, said trait is not very rigid, may change with 
                time or with individual interaction.  For example, Geeks
                who happen to very much enjoy Star Trek:  The Next Generation,
                but dislike the old 60's series might list themselves as
                t++@.
        ()      for indicating "cross-overs" or ranges.  Geeks who go from 
                c+ to c--- depending on the situation (i.e. mostly "c+") could
but
                also has an extensive collection of other types of works.

        @ is different from () in that () has finite limits within the
        category, while @ ranges all over.

-----------------------

Type:
Geeks come in many flavors.  The flavors relate to the vocation of the
particular geek.  To start a code, a geek must declare himself or herself to
be a geek.  To do this, we start the code with a "G" to denote "GEEK",
followed by one or two letters to denote the geeks occupation or field of
study.  Multi-talented geeks with more than one vocation should denote their 
myriad of talents with a slash between each vocation (example:  GCS/MU/T).

        GB      --  Geek of Business
        GCS     --  Geek of Computer Science
        GE      --  Geek of Engineering
        GM      --  Geek of Math
        GMU     --  Geek of Music
        GS      --  Geek of Science (Physics, Chemistry, Biology, etc.)
        GSS     --  Geek of Social Science (Psychology, Sociology, etc.)
        GT      --  Geek of Theater

        GO      --  Geek of Other.  Some types of geeks deviate from the
                    normal geek activities.  This is encouraged as true geeks 
                    come from all walks of life.
        GU      --  Geek of 'Undecided'.  This is a popular vocation with
                    new freshmen.

        GAT     --  Geek of All Trades.  For those geeks that can do
                    anything and everything.  GAT usually precludes the use
                    of other vocational descriptors.

----------------------

Dress:
Geeks come in many different types of dress.

        d       I dress a lot like those in Walmart ads
        d+      I tend to wear trendy political messages like "Save the
                Whales" or "Free South Africa".
        d++     I tend to wear conservative dress such as a business
                suit.
        d-      I tend to wear trendy political messages like "Nuke the
                Humans", "Question Authority", or "Big Brother's Watching".
        d--     I wear jeans to work just to piss off my boss
        d---    At work, I have holes in my jeans and/or obscenities on
                my shirt.

        d?      I have no idea what I am wearing right now, let alone
                what I wore yesterday.
        !d      No clothing.  Quite a fashion statement, don't you think?
        -d+     I wear the same clothes all the time, no matter the
                occasion, often forgetting to do laundry between wearings.

---------------------

Politics:
Just as the Geek's sense of fashion is varied, so is his/her political
convictions.

        p       Politics?  I've heard of that somewhere but in all honesty
                I really don't give a shit.
        p+      Let's get the government off of big-business's back
        p++     All in favor of eliminating free speech, say aye!
        p+++    Fuckin' Minorities!  Adolf Hitler is my hero!
        p-      Bring back the 60's
        p--     I'm still living in the 60's
        p---    No taxes through no government
        
        -p+     Don't label me you moron!  Both sides are equally fucked up!

---------------------

Computers:
Most geeks identify themselves by their use of computers and computer
networks.  In order to quantify your geekiness level on computers, consult
the following (consider the term 'computers' synonymous with 'computer
network'):

        c       Computers are a tool, nothing more.  I use it when it serves
                my purpose.
        c+      Computers are fun and I enjoy using them.  I play a mean
                game of Wing Commander and can use a word processor without 
                resorting to the manual too often.  I know that a 3.5" disk 
                is not a hard disk.  I also know that when it says 'press any 
                key to continue', I don't have to look for a key labeled 
'ANY'.
        c++     Computers are a large part of my existence.  When I get up
                in the morning, the first thing I do is log myself in.  I mud
                on weekends, but still manage to stay off of academic 
                probation.
        c+++    You mean there is life outside of Internet?  You're shittin'
                me!  I live for muds.  I haven't dragged myself to class in
                weeks.
        c++++   I'll be first in line to get the new cybernetic interface 
                installed into my skull.        
        c-      Anything more complicated than my calculator and I'm
                screwed.
        c--     Where's the on switch?
        c---    If you even mention computers, I will rip your head off!

-------------------

Linux:
Linux is a hacker-written operating system virtually identical to unix.  It
runs on your standard 386/486 PC computers and offers multitasking support
far superior to DOS.  Because it is still a young OS, and because it is
continually evolving from hacker changes and support, it is important that
the geek list his Linux ability.

        l       I know what Linux is, but that's about all
        l+      I've managed to get Linux installed and even used it a few
                times.  It seems like it is just another OS.
        l++     I use Linux almost exclusively on my system.  I monitor
                comp.os.linux and even answer questions some times.  I've 
                aliased Linux FTP sites to make getting new software easier.
        l+++    I am a Linux wizard.  I munch C code for breakfast and have 
                enough room left over for a kernel debugging.  I have so
                many patches installed that I lost track about ten versions
                ago.  Linux newbies consider me a net.god.
        l-      I have no desire to use Linux and frankly don't give a rats
                ass about it.
        l--     Unix sucks.  Because Linux = Unix.  Linux Sucks.  I worship
                Bill Gates.

        !l      I don't even use an 80x86 chip, so linux isn't really a
                reality for me. (ie, Mac people).
        l?      What the hell is Linux?  I've never even heard of it.

-------------------

Unix:
Just as geeks sometimes use Linux, a great many geeks also use generic Unix
machines to accomplish their geeky ends.  
        
        u       I have a unix account to do my stuff in
        u+      I not only have a unix account, but I slam VMS any chance I
                get.
        u++     I've get the entire admin ticked off at me because I am
                always using all of the CPU time and trying to run programs 
                that I don't have access to.  I'm going to try cracking
                /etc/passwd next week, just don't tell anyone.
        u-      I have a VMS account. 
        u--     I've seen unix and didn't like it.  DEC rules!
        u---    Unix geeks are actually nerds in disguise.

--------------------
Education:
All geeks have a varying amount of education.

        e       K-12, been on a college campus. 
        e+      Started a B.S./B.A, plan to finish it some day. 
        e++     Had not learned enough to know better not to go back and try
                for a master's degree. 
        e+++    Still pretty stupid, over qualified to work any job, went and
                got my Ph.D. 
        e-      Got my bachelors, escaped alive, and am making hoards of money
                writing unmaintainable (except by me) software. 
        e--     The company I work for was dumb enough to fund my way through
                a masters degree, then started paying me even more money. 
        e---    Achieved a Ph.D, have devoted my life to insignificant 
research,
                which my employer pays dearly for. 
itchhiker's Trilogy". 

--------------------
Music:
Musical interests vary widely, also.

        m       I occasionally listen to the radio
        m+      I own a tape or CD collection (records also count, but you
                would be admitting how old you really are).
        m++     I consider myself refined and enjoy classical and new-age
                selections
        m+++    I consider myself over-refined and grok that heavy-duty
                elevator music.
        m-      Just play it loud
        m--     I play air-guitar better than anyone else.
        m---    LISTEN!  I SAID TO PLAY IT LOUD!
       
        !n      Eh what? never mind the menu, give me something to eat! 
        n+      I like food - especially when it is healthy. 
        n++     I like the fibers in food
        n-      Food? I just grab something from the shelves with meat in it. 
        n--     I eat only the cheap things - even with artificial meat and
                vegetables.
        n---    I _live_ on snacks and coke. 

--------------------
Housing:
    
        h       Friends come over to visit every once in a while to talk
                about Geek things.  There is a place for them to sit. 
        h+      Living alone, get out once a week to buy food, no more than
                once a month to do laundry.  All surfaces covered. 
        h++     Living in a cave with 47 computers and an Internet feed, 
                located near a Dominoes pizza.  See !d. 
        h-      Living with one or more registered Geeks.
        h--     Living with one or more people who know nothing about being a
                Geek and refuse to watch 'Star Trek'. 
        h---    Married, with the potential for children. (persons living
                with a fiance might as well label themselves h---, you're as
      sses
        g+      I've got four eyes, what's your point?
        g++     I've got four eyes and tape in the middle
        g+++    I have coke-bottle classes that I can use to start leaves on
                fire in the hot sun.
        g-      I have contacts
        g--     I have colored contacts 
        g---    I have those funky contact that have interesting designs on
                them such as happy faces or some such.

--------------------

Weirdness:
Geeks have a seemingly natural knack for being "weird".  Of course, this is
a subjective term as one person's weirdness is another person's normalness. 
As a general rule, the following weird qualifiers allow a geek to rate their
weirdness. 
        
        w       I am not weird.  I'm perfectly normal.
        w+      so?  what's your problem with weird.
        w++     I am so weird, I make Al Yankovic look sane.
        w+++    Mainstream?  I heard of that once, I think.
        w-      I'm more normal that most people normally are.
        w--     Isn't everyone in the p+ group?  
        
--------------------

Star Trek:
Most geeks have an undeniable love for the Star Trek television (in any of
its three forms).  Because GEEK is often synonymous with TREKKIE, it is
important that all geeks list their Trek rating.

        t       It's just another TV show
        t+      It's a damn fine TV show and is one of the only things
                good on television any more. 
        t++     It's the best show around.  I have all the episodes and the
                movies on tape and can quote entire scenes verbatim.  I've 
                built a few of the model kits too.  But you'll never catch me
                at one of those conventions.  Those people are kooks.
        t+++    It's not just a TV show, its a religion.  I know all about
                warp field dynamics and the principles behind the 
                transporter.  I have memorized the TECH manual.  I speak 
                Klingon.  I go to cons with Vulcan ears on.  I have no life.
        t-      Maybe it is just me, but I have no idea what the big deal
                with Star Trek is.  Perhaps I'm missing something but I just
                think it is bad drama.
        t--     Star Trek is just another Space Opera.  William Shatner isn't
                an actor, he's a poser!  And what's with this Jean-Luc Picard?

                A Frenchman with a British accent?  Come on.  I'd only watch 
                this show if my remote control broke.   
        t---    Star Trek SUCKS!  It is the worst crap I have ever seen! 
                Hey, all you trekkies out there, GET A LIFE!  (William
                Shatner is a t---)

--------------------

Role Playing:
Role-playing games such as Dungeons & Dragons have long been a part of the
traditional geek life.  Because geeks often become so involved in their
role-playing that they lose touch with reality, include one of the following
role-playing codes.

        r       Role-Playing?  That's just something to do to kill a 
                Saturday afternoon
        r+      I've got my weekly sessions set up and a character that I
                know better than I know myself.
        r++     There is no life outside the role of the die.  I know all of
                piddly rules of (chosen game).  _MY_ own warped rules scare 
                the rest of the players.  
        r+++    I worship E. Gary Gygax.
        r-      Gosh, what an utter waste of time!
        r--     Role-Players worship SATAN!

--------------------

Sex:
Geeks have traditionally had problems with sex (ie, they never have any).
Because geeks are so wrapped up in their sexuality (or lack of sexuality for
that matter), it is important that the geek be willing to quantify their
sexual experiences.

This code also is used to denote the gender of the geek.  Females use 'x' in
this category, while males use 'y'.  For example:
        x+      A female who has had sex
        y+      A male who has had sex.

For those person who do not wish to give out any details of their sex life,
the use of x? (where x is the gender code) will allow you to so.

        !x      Sex?  What's that?  I've had no sexual experiences.
        x+      I've had real, live sex. 
        x++     I was once referred to as 'easy'.  I have no idea where that
                might have come from though.
     

5. Before you log on with your favorite  psuedonym,  make  sure
that  handles  are allowed. Most Sysops don't want people using
handles on the system. There is not enough room for them,  they
get  silly  games of one-upmanship started, it is much nicer to
deal with a person on a personal basis, and last but not least,
everyone should be willing to take full responsibility for  his
actions  or  comments  instead  of  slinging  mud from behind a
phoney name.

6. Take the time to log on properly. There is no such place  as
RIV,  HB,  ANA  or any of a thousand other abbreviations people
use instead of their proper city. You may think  that  everyone
knows  what  RIV  is supposed to mean, but every BBS has people
calling from all around the  country  and  I  assure  you  that
someone  from  Podunk  Iowa  has  no  idea  what you're talking
about.

7. Don't go out of your way  to  make  rude  observations  like
"Gee,  this  system  is  slow".  Every  BBS  is  a  tradeoff of
features. You can generally assume that if someone is running a
particular brand of software, that he is either happy  with  it
or he'll decide to find another system he likes better. It does
nobody any good when you make comments about something that you
perceive  to  be  a  flaw  when it is running the way the Sysop
wants it to. Constructive criticism is somewhat  more  welcome.
If you have an alternative method that seems to make good sense
then run it up the flagpole.

8.  When  leaving messages, stop and ask yourself whether it is
necessary to make it private. Unless there is  some  particular
reason  that  everyone shouldn't know what you're saying, don't
make it private. We don't call them PUBLIC bulletin boards  for
nothing,  folks.  It's  very  irritating  to other callers when
there are huge blank spots in the messages that they can't read
and it stifles interaction between callers.

9. If your favorite BBS has a time limit,  observe  it.  If  it
doesn't,  set  a  limit  for  yourself and abide by it instead.
Don't tie up a system until it finally kicks you off  and  then
call  back  with  another  name.  This  same  rule  applies  to
downloading or playing games. Only one person at a time can  be
logged  on  to  a BBS and it isn't fair to everyone else if you
overstay your welcome. Remember, a BBS is best when it  can  be
left  wide  open.  If you try and cheat the rules you just hurt
everybody by forcing the Sysop to adopt more strigent policies.
I can't count the number of systems that are now locked tighter
than a drum because of people who cheat and abuse.

10. Don't call a BBS just to look at  the  list  of  other  BBS
numbers.  Most especially don't call a system as a new user and
run right to the other numbers list.  There  is  probably  very
little that's more annoying to any Sysop than to have his board
completely passed over by you on your way to another board.

11. Have the common courtesy to pay attention to what passes in
front  of your face. When a BBS displays your name and asks "Is
this you?", don't say yes when you can see perfectly well  that
it  is  mispelled.  Also,  don't  start  asking questions about
simple operation of a system until you have thouroghly read all
of the instructions that are available to  you.  I  assure  you
that  it  isn't any fun to answer a question for the thousandth
time when the answer is prominently  displayed  in  the  system
bulletins  or  instructions. Use some common sense when you ask
your questions. The person who said "There's no such thing as a
stupid question" obviously never operated a BBS.

12. If by some  chance you should encounter  an error while you
are online (Heaven forbid!),  ALWAYS take the time to leave the
Sysop  a message describing the  circumstances.  Don't just say
"There was an error". That is not helpful in the least. Chances
are that he knows there was an error.  What he needs to know is
what you were doing when the error occurred so that he can have
some chance of finding and correcting it. If the error happened
after you input something,  tell him what it was. Remember that
a BBS can't improve unless you're willing to help.

13. Don't be personally abusive. It doesn't matter whether  you
like a Sysop or think he's a jerk. The fact remains that he has
a  large  investment  in making his computer available, usually
out of the goodness of his heart. If you don't like a Sysop  or
his  system,  just remember that you can change the channel any
time  you want.  Calling a  Sysop  names or  making  uninformed
comments  about his lifestyle only shows  you for the child you
really are.

14.  Keep  firmly  in  mind that you are a guest on any BBS you
happen to call. Don't think of logging on as one of your  basic
human  rights. Every person that has ever put a computer system
online for the use of other people has spent a lot of time  and
money  to  do  so.  While he doesn't expect nonstop pats on the
back, it seems reasonable that he should at least  be  able  to
expect fair treatment from his callers. This includes following
any  of  the  rules  for  system  use  he  has laid out without
grumping about it. Every Sysop has his own idea of how he wants
his system to be run. It is really none of your business why he
wants to run it the way he does. Your  business  is  to  either
abide by what  he says,  or call some other  BBS where you feel
that you can obey the rules.

through the phone line like junk through an addict's veins, an

                                      ABSTRACT



               This paper examines the social organization of the

               "computer underground" (CU).  The CU is composed of

               actors in three roles, "computer hackers," "phone

               phreaks," and "software pirates."  These roles have

               frequently been ignored or confused in media and other

               accounts of CU activity. By utilizing a data set culled

               from CU channels of communication this paper provides

               an ethnographic account of computer underground

               organization. It is concluded that despite the

               widespread social network of the computer underground,

               it is organized primarily on the level of colleagues,

               with only small groups approaching peer relationships.

                                    Introduction

                    The proliferation of home computers has been

               accompanied by a corresponding social problem involving

               the activities of so-called "computer hackers."

               "Hackers" are computer aficionados who "break in" to

               corporate and government computer systems using their

               home computer and a telephone modem.  The prevalence of

               the problem has been dramatized by the media and

               enforcement agents, and evidenced by the rise of

               specialized private security firms to confront the

               "hackers."  But despite this flurry of attention,

               little research has examined the social world of the

               "computer hacker." Our current knowledge in this regard

               derives from hackers who have been caught, from

               enforcement agents, and from computer security

               specialists.  The everyday world and activities of the

               "computer hacker" remain largely unknown.

                    This study examines the way actors in the

               "computer underground" (CU) organize to perform their

               acts. The computer underground, as it is called by

               those who participate in it, is composed of actors

               adhering to one of three roles: "hackers," "phreakers,"

               or "pirates." To further understanding this growing

               "social problem," this project will isolate and clarify
^



                                                                     8

               these roles, and examine how each contributes to the

               culture as a whole. By doing so the sociological

               question of how the "underground" is organized will be

               answered, rather than the technical question of how CU

               participants perform their acts.

                    Best and Luckenbill (1982) describe three basic

               approaches to the study of "deviant" groups.  The first

               approach is from a social psychological level, where

               analysis focuses on the needs, motives, and individual

               characteristics of the actors involved.  Secondly,

               deviant groups can be studied at a socio-structural

               level.  Here the emphasis is on the distribution and

               consequences of deviance within the society as a whole.

               The third approach, the one adopted by this work, forms

               a middle ground between the former two by addressing

               the social organization of deviant groups.   Focusing

               upon neither the individual nor societal structures

               entirely, social organization refers to the network of

               social relations between individuals involved in a

               common activity (pp. 13-14).  Assessing the degree and

               manner in which the underground is organized provides

               the opportunity to also examine the culture, roles, and

               channels of communication used by the computer

               underground. The focus here is on the day to day

               experience of persons whose activities have been
^



                                                                     9

               criminalized over the past several years.

                    Hackers, and the "danger" that they present in our

               computer dependent society, have often received

               attention from the legal community and the media. Since

               1980, every state and the federal government has

               criminalized  "theft by browsing" of computerized

               information (Hollinger and Lanza-Kaduce, 1988, pp.101-

               102). In the media, hackers have been portrayed as

               maladjusted losers, forming "high-tech street gangs"

               (Chicago Tribune, 1989) that are dangerous to society.

               My research will show that the computer underground

               consists of a more sophisticated level of social

               organization than has been generally recognized. The

               very fact that CU participants are to some extent

               "networked" has implications for social control

               policies that may have been implemented based on an in-

               complete understanding of the activity. This project

               not only offers sociological insight into the organ-

               ization of deviant associations, but may be helpful to

               policy makers as well.

                    I begin with a discussion of the definitional

               problems that inhibit the sociological analysis of the

               computer underground. The emergence of the computer

               underground is a recent phenomenon, and the lack of

               empirical research on the topic has created an area
^



                                                                    10

               where few "standard" definitions and categories exist.

               This work will show that terms such as "hacker,"

               "phreaker," and "pirate" have different meanings for

               those who have written about the computer underground

               and those who participate in it. This work bridges

               these inconsistencies by providing definitions that

               focus on the intentions and goals of the participants,

               rather than the legality or morality of their actions.

                    Following the definition of CU activities is a

               discussion of the structure of the underground.

               Utilizing a typology for understanding the social

               organization of deviant associations, developed by Best

               and Luckenbill (1982), the organization of the

               computer underground is examined in depth.

                    The analysis begins by examining the structure of

               mutual association. This provides insight into how CU

               activity is organized, the ways in which information is

               obtained and disseminated, and explores the subcultural

               facets of the computer underground.  More importantly,

               it clearly illustrates that the computer underground is

               primarily a social network of individuals that perform

               their acts separately, yet support each other by

               sharing information and other resources.

                    After describing mutual association within the

               underground community, evidence of mutual participation

               is presented. Although the CU is a social network, the

               ties developed at the social level encourage the

               formation of small "work groups." At this level, some

               members of the CU work in cooperation to perform their

               acts. The organization and purposes of these groups are

               examined, as well as their relationship to the CU as a

               whole. However, because only limited numbers of

               individuals join these short-lived associations, it is

               concluded that the CU is organized as colleagues. Those

               who do join "work groups" display the characteristics

               of peers, but most CU activity takes place at a fairly

               low level of sophistication.

                                    Methodology

                    Adopting an ethnographic approach, data have been

               gathered by participating in, monitoring, and cata-

               loging channels of communication used by active members

               of the computer underground. These channels, which will

               be examined in detail later,  include electronic

               bulletin board systems (BBS), voice mail boxes,

               bridges, loops, e-mail, and telephone conversations.

               These sources provide a window through which to observe

               interactions, language, and cultural meanings without

               intruding upon the situation or violating the privacy

               of the participants.  Because these communication

               centers are the "back stage" area of the computer

               underground, they provided insight into organizational

               (and other) issues that CU participants face, and the

               methods they use to resolve them.

                    As with any ethnographic research, steps have been

               taken to protect the identity of informants.  The

               culture of the computer underground aids the researcher

               in this task since phreakers, hackers, and pirates

               regularly adopt pseudonyms to mask their identity.

               However to further ensure confidentiality, all of the

               pseudonyms cited in this research have been changed by

               the author. Additionally, any information that is

               potentially incriminating has been removed or altered.

                    The data set used for this study consists

               primarily of messages, or "logs," which are the primary

               form of communication between users.  These logs were

               "captured" (recorded using the computer to save the

               messages) from several hundred computer bulletin

               boards1 located across the United States.  The bulk of

               the data were gathered over a seventeen month period

               (12/87 to 4/89) and will reflect the characteristics of

               the computer underground during that time span.

               However, some data, provided to the researcher by

               cooperative subjects, dates as far back as 1984.

                    The logged data were supplemented by referring to

               several CU "publications."  The members of the computer

               underground produce and distribute several technical

               and tutorial newsletters and "journals."  Since these

               "publications" are not widely available outside of CU

               circles I have given a brief description of each below.

               publication is written and distributed by a group known

               as "The Legion of Doom/Legion of Hackers" (LoD/H).  It

               is available in electronic format (a computer text

               file) and contains highly technical information on

               computer operating systems. As of this writing, three

               issues have been published.

                    PHRACK Inc.:  Phrack Inc is a newsletter that

               contains various articles, written by different

               authors, and "published" under one banner.  Phrack

               Inc's first issue was released in 1985, making it the

               oldest of the electronically distributed underground

               publications.  CU participants are invited to submit

               articles to the editors, who release a new issue when a

               sufficient number (about nine) of acceptable pieces

               have been gathered. Phrack also features a lengthy

               "World News" with stories about hackers who have been

               apprehended and interviews with various members of the

               underground. As of this writing twenty-seven issues of

               Phrack, have been published.

                    Phreakers/Hackers Underground Network (P/Hun):

               Like Phrack, P/Hun collects articles from various

               authors and releases them as one issue.  Three issues

               have been published to date.

               other electronically distributed publications, ATI does

               not limit itself to strictly computer/telephone news.

               Articles normally include commentary on world and

               government events, and other "general interest" topics.

               ATI issues are generally small and consist of articles

               written by a core group of four to seven people.

               Unlike the publications discussed thus far, ATI is

               available in printed "hard copy" form by sending

               postage reimbursement to the editor.  ATI is currently

               on their 38th issue.

                    2600 Magazine:  Published in a traditional

               (printed) magazine format, 2600 (named for the

               frequency tone used to make free long distance phone

               calls) is arguably an "underground" publication as it

               is available on some newsstands and at some libraries.

               Begun in 1987 as a monthly magazine, it is now

               published quarterly. Subscription rates are $25.00 a

               year with a complete back-issue selection available.

               The magazine specializes in publishing technical

               information on telephone switching systems, satellite

               descrambling codes, and news about the computer

               underground.

                    TAP/YIPL: First established in 1972 as YIPL (Youth

               International Party Line), this publication soon

               changed its name to TAP (Technical Assistance Party).

               as the grandfather of computer underground

               publications.  Publication of the 2-4 page newsletter

               has been very sporadic over the years, and currently

               two different versions of TAP, each published in

               different areas of the country, are in circulation.

                    Utilizing a data set that consists of current

               message logs, old messages logs, and various CU

               publications yields a reasonably rich collection from

               which to draw the analysis.  Examination of the older

               logs and publications shows that while the actors have

               changed over the years, cultural norms and

               characteristics have remained consistent over time.

                          What is the Computer Underground?

                    Defining the "computer underground" can be

               difficult. The sociologist soon finds that there are

               several competing definitions of computer underground

               activity.  Those who have written on the subject, the

               media, criminologists, computer programmers, social

               control agents, and CU participants themselves, have

               adopted definitions consistent with their own social

               positions and perspectives. Not surprisingly, these

               definitions rarely correspond. Therefore, before

               discussing the organization of the computer

               underground, it is necessary to discuss and compare the

               various definitions.  This will illustrate the range of

               beliefs about CU activity, and provide a springboard

               for the discussion of types of roles and activities

               found in the underground.

                    We begin with a discussion of the media image of

               computer hackers. The media's concept of "hackers" is

               important because the criminalization of the activity

               has largely occurred as the result of media drama-

               tization of the "problem" (Hollinger and Lanza-Kaduce,

               1988). In fact, it was a collection of newspaper and

               film clips that was presented to the United States

               Congress during legislative debates as evidence of the
^



                                                                    18

               computer hacking problem (Hollinger and Lanza-Kaduce,

               1988, p.107).  Unfortunately, the media assessment of

               the computer underground displays a naive understanding

               of CU activity.

                    The media generally makes little distinction

               between different types of CU activity. Most any

               computer-related crime activity can be attributed to

               "hackers."  Everything from embezzlement to computer

               viruses have, at one time or another, been attributed

               to them. Additionally, hackers are often described as

               being sociopathic or malicious, creating a media image

               of the computer underground that may exaggerate their

               propensity for doing damage.

                    The labeling of hackers as being "evil" is well

               illustrated by two recent media examples. The first is

               from Eddie Schwartz, a WGN-Radio talk show host. Here

               Schwartz is addressing "Anna," a self-identified hacker

               that has phoned into the show:

                    You know what Anna, you know what disturbs
                    me? You don't sound like a stupid person but
                    you represent a . . . a . . . a . . . lack of
                    morality that disturbs me greatly. You really
                    do. I think you represent a certain way of
                    thinking that is morally bankrupt. And I'm
                    not trying to offend you, but I . . . I'm
                    offended by you! (WGN Radio, 1988)

                    Just two months later, NBC-TV's "Hour Magazine"

               featured a segment on "computer crime."  In this

               example, Jay Bloombecker, director of the National

                                                                    19

               Center for Computer Crime Data, discusses the "hacker

               problem" with the host of the show, Gary Collins.

                    Collins: . . . are they %hackers% malicious
                    in intent, or are they simply out to prove,
                    ah, a certain machismo amongst their peers?

                    Bloombecker: I think so. I've talked about
                    "modem macho" as one explanation for what's
                    being done. And a lot of the cases seem to
                    involve %proving% %sic% that he . . . can do
                    something really spiffy with computers. But,
                    some of the cases are so evil, like causing
                    so many computers to break, they can't look
                    at that as just trying to prove that you're
                    better than other people.

                    GC: So that's just some of it, some kind of
                    "bet" against the computer industry, or
                    against the company.

                    JB: No, I think it's more than just
                    rottenness. And like someone who uses
                    graffiti doesn't care too much whose building
                    it is, they just want to be destructive.

                    GC: You're talking about a sociopath in
                    control of a computer!

                    JB: Ah, lots of computers, because there's
                    thousands, or tens of thousands %of hackers%
                    (NBC-TV, 1988).


                    The media image of computer hackers, and thus all

               members of the computer underground, is burdened with

               value-laden assumptions about their psychological

               makeup, and focuses almost entirely upon the morality

               of their actions.  Additionally, since media stories

               are taken from the accounts of police blotters,

               security personnel, and hackers who have been caught,

               each of whom have different perspectives and
^



                                                                    20

               definitions of their own, the media definition, if not

               inherently biased, is at best inconsistent.

                    Criminologists, by way of contrast, have done

               little to define the computer underground from a

               sociological perspective.  Those criminological

               definitions that do exist are less judgmental than the

               media image, but no more precise. Labels of

               "electronic trespassers" (Parker, 1983), and

               "electronic vandals" (Bequai, 1987) have both been

               applied to hackers.  Both terms, while acknowledging

               that "hacking" is deviant, shy away from labeling it as

               "criminal" or sociopathic behavior.  Yet despite this

               seemingly non-judgmental approach to the computer

               underground, both Parker and Bequai have testified

               before Congress, on behalf of the computer security in-

               dustry, on the "danger" of computer hackers.

               Unfortunately, their "expert" testimony was largely

               based on information culled from newspaper stories, the

               objectiveness of which has been seriously questioned

               (Hollinger and Lanza-Kaduce 1988 p.105).

                    Computer security specialists, on the other hand,

               are often quick to identify CU participants as part of

               the criminal element. Correspondingly, some reject the

               notion that there are different roles and motivations

               among computer underground participants and thereby
^



                                                                    21

               refuse to define just what it is that a "hacker" or

               "phreaker" does.  John Maxfield, a "hacker expert,"

               suggests that differentiating between "hackers" and

               "phone phreaks" is a moot point, preferring instead

               that they all just be called "criminals" (WGN-Radio.

               Sept 28, 1988).

                    The reluctance or inability to differentiate

               between roles and activities in the computer

               underground, as exhibited in the media and computer

               security firms, creates an ambiguous definition of

               "hacker" that possesses  two extremes: the modern-day

               bank robber at one end, the trespassing teenager at the

               other.  Thus, most any criminal or mischievous act that

               involves computers can be attributed to "hackers,"2

               regardless of the nature of the crime.

                    Further compounding the inconsistent use of

               "hacker" is the evolution of meaning that the word has

               undergone.   "Hacker" was first  applied to computer

               related activities when it was used by programmers in

               the late 1950's.  At that time it referred to the

               pioneering researchers, such as those at M.I.T., who

               that "computer hackers" were responsible for the
               problem.  The panel assured her that it was unrelated
               to CU activity.

               were constantly adjusting and experimenting with the

               new technology (Levy, 1984. p.7).  A "hacker" in this

               context refers to an unorthodox, yet talented,

               professional programmer. This use of the term still

               exits today, though it is largely limited to

               professional computing circles.

                    Another definition of "hacker" refers to one who

               obtains unauthorized, if not illegal, access to

               computer systems and networks.  This definition was

               popularized by the movie War Games and, generally

               speaking, is the one used by the media.3 It is also the

               definition favored by the computer underground.

                    Both the members of the computer underground and

               computer programmers claim ownership of "hacker," and

               each defend the "proper" use of term.  The computer

               professionals maintain that using "hackers" (or

               "hacking") to refer to any illegal or illicit activity

               is a corruption of the "true" meaning of the word.  Bob

               Bickford, a professional programmer who has organized

               several programmer conferences, explains:
               ____________________

                    3 This is not always true of course.  The AP
               Stylebook has yet to specify how "hacker" should be
               used.  A recent  Associated Press story featured a
               computer professional explaining that a "real hacker"
               would never do anything illegal.  Yet just a few weeks
               later Associated Press distributed stories proclaiming
               that West German "hackers" had broken into US Defense
               Department computer systems.

                    At the most recent conference %called
                    "Hackers 4.0"% we had 200 of the most
                    brilliant computer professionals in the world
                    together for one weekend; this crowd included
                    several PhD's, several presidents of
                    companies (including large companies, such as
                    Pixar), and various artists, writers,
                    engineers, and programmers.  These people all
                    consider themselves Hackers: all derive great
                    joy from their work, from finding ways around
                    problems and limits, from creating rather
                    than destroying.  It would be a great
                    disservice to these people, and the thousands
                    of professionals like them, to let some
                    pathetic teenaged criminals destroy the one
                    word which captures their style of
                    interaction with the universe: Hackers
                    (Bickford, 1988).

                    Participants in the computer underground also

               object to the "misuse" of the term. Their objection

               centers around the indiscriminate use of the word to

               refer to computer related crime in general and not,

               specifically, the activities of the computer

               underground:

                    Whenever the slightest little thing happens
                    involving computer security, or the breach
                    thereof, the media goes fucking bat shit and
                    points all their fingers at us 'nasty
                    hackers.' They're so damned ignorant it's
                    sick (EN, message log, 1988).

                    . . . whenever the media happens upon
                    anything that involves malicious computer use
                    it's the "HACKERS."  The word is a catch
                    phrase it makes mom drop the dishes and watch
                    the TV.  They use the word because not only
                    they don't really know the meaning but they
                    have lack of a word to describe the
                    perpetrator.  That's why hacker has such a
                    bad name, its always associated with evil
                    things and such (PA, message log, 1988).

                    I never seen a phreaker called a phreaker

                                                                    24

                    when caught and he's printed in the
                    newspaper. You always see them "Hacker caught
                    in telephone fraud."  "Hacker defrauds old
                    man with phone calling card." What someone
                    should do is tell the fucken (sic) media to
                    get it straight (TP2, message log, 1988).


                    Obviously the CU and computer professional

               definitions of "hacker" refer to different social

               groups.  As Best and Luckenbill (1982, p. 39) observe:

               "Every social group modifies the basic language to fit

               its own circumstance, creating new words or using

               ordinary words in special ways."  Which definition, if

               either, will come into widespread use remains to be

               seen.  However, since computer break-ins are likely to

               receive more media attention than clever feats of

               programming, the CU definition is likely to dominate

               simply by being used more often.4  But as long as the

               two definitions do exist there will be confusion unless

               writers and researchers adequately specify the group

               under discussion.  For this reason, I suggest that

               sociologists, and criminologists in particular, adopt

               the "underground" definition for consistency and
               ____________________

                    4 Another factor may be the adoption  of a close
               proximity to the underground definition being included
               in the 1986 edition of Webster's New World dictionary:
                    hack.er n. 1. a person who hacks 2. an unskilled
               golfer, tennis player, etc. 3. a talented amateur user
               of computers, specif. one who attempts to gain
               unauthorized access to files.

               accuracy when speaking of the actions of CU

               participants.

                    While it is recognized that computer hacking is a

               relatively new phenomenon, the indiscriminant use of

               the term to refer to many different forms of unorthodox

               computer use has been counterproductive to

               understanding the extent of the activity. To avoid this

               a "computer hacker" should be defined as an individual,

               associated with the computer underground, who

               specializes in obtaining unauthorized access to

               computer systems.  A "phone phreak" in an individual,

               associated with the computer underground, who

               specializes in obtaining unauthorized information about

               the phone system.  A "software pirate" is an

               individual, associated with the computer underground,

               who distributes or collects copyrighted computer

               software. These definitions have been derived from the

               data, instead of relying upon those who defend the

               "integrity" of the original meanings, or those who are

               unfamiliar with the culture.

                       Topography of the Computer Underground

                    Having defined the three main roles in the

               computer underground, it is necessary to examine each

               activity separately in order to provide a general

               typology of the computer underground.  In doing so, the

               ways in which each contributes to the culture as a

               whole will be illustrated, and the divisions between

               them that affect the overall organization will be

               developed. Analysis of these roles and divisions is

               crucial to understanding identity, access, and mobility

               within the culture.



               Hacking

                    In the vernacular of the computer underground,

               "hacking" refers to gaining access and exploring

               computer systems and networks. "Hacking" encompasses

               both the act and the methods used to obtain valid user

               accounts on computer systems.

                      "Hacking" also refers to the activity that

               occurs once access to another computer has been

               obtained. Since the system is being used without

               authorization, the hacker does not, generally speaking,

               have access to the usual operating manuals and other

               resources that are available to legitimate users.
^



                                                                    27

               Therefore, the hacker must experiment with commands and

               explore various files in order to understand and

               effectively use the system.  The goal here is to

               explore and experiment with the system that has been

               entered. By examining files and, perhaps, by a little

               clever programming, the hacker may be able to obtain

               protected information or more powerful access

               privileges.5



               Phreaking

                    Another role in the computer underground is that

               of the "phone phreak."  Phone phreaking, usually called

               just "phreaking," was widely publicized when the

               exploits of John "Cap'n Crunch" Draper, the "father of

               phreaking," were publicized in a 1971 Esquire magazine

               article.

                    The term "phreaking" encompasses several different

               means of circumventing  the billing mechanisms of

               telephone companies.  By using these methods, long-
               ____________________

                    5 Contrary to the image sometimes perpetuated by
               computer security consultants, the data indicate that
               hackers refrain from deliberately destroying data or
               otherwise damaging the system.  Doing so would conflict
               with their instrumental goal of blending in with the
               average user so as not to attract undue attention to
               their presence and cause the account to be deleted.
               After spending what may be a substantial amount of time
               obtaining a high access  account, the hacker places a
               high priority on not being discovered using it.

                                                                    28

               distance phone calls can be placed without cost. In

               many cases the methods also prevent, or at least

               inhibit, the possibility of calls being traced to their

               source thereby helping the phreaker to avoid being

               caught.

                    Early phreaking methods involved electro-

               mechanical devices that generated key tones, or altered

               line voltages in certain ways as to trick the

               mechanical switches of the phone company into

               connecting calls without charging.  However the advent

               of computerized telephone-switching systems largely

               made these devices obsolete.  In order to continue

               their practice the phreaks have had to learn hacking

               skills:6

                    Phreaking and hacking have just recently
                    merged, because now, the telephone companies
                    are using computers to operate their network.
                    So, in order to learn more about these
                    computers in relation to the network, phreaks
                    have learned hacking skills, and can now
                    program, and get around inside the machines
                    (AF, message log, 1988).

                    For most members of the computer underground,

               phreaking is simply a tool that allows them to call

               long distance without amassing enormous phone bills.
               ____________________

                    6 Because the two activities are so closely
               related, with phreakers learning hacking skills and
               hackers breaking into "telco" computers, reference is
               usually made to phreak/hacking or "p/hackers."  This
               paper follows this convention.

                                                                    29

               Those who have a deeper and more technically oriented

               interest in the "telco" (telephone company) are known

               as phreakers. They, like the hackers discussed earlier,

               desire to master and explore a system that few

               outsiders really understand:

                    The phone system is the most interesting,
                    fascinating thing that I know of. There is so
                    much to know. Even phreaks have their own
                    areas of knowledge.  There is so much to know
                    that  one phreak could know something fairly
                    important and the next  phreak not.  The next
                    phreak might know ten things that the  first
                    phreak doesn't though. It all depends upon
                    where and  how they get their info.  I myself
                    %sic% would like to work for the telco, doing
                    something interesting, like programming a
                    switch. Something that isn't slave labor
                    bullshit. Something that you enjoy, but have
                    to take risks in order to participate unless
                    you are lucky enough to work for the telco.
                    To have access to telco things, manuals, etc
                    would be great (DP, message log, 1988).

                    Phreaking involves having the dedication to
                    commit yourself to learning as much about the
                    phone system/network as possible. Since most
                    of this information is not made public,
                    phreaks have to resort to legally
                    questionable means to obtain the knowledge
                    they want (TP2, message log, 1988).



                    Most members of the underground do not approach

               the telephone system with such passion. Many hackers

               are interested in the phone system solely to the extent

               that they can exploit its weaknesses and pursue other

               goals.  In this case, phreaking becomes a means and not

               a pursuit unto itself. Another individual, one who

                                                                    30

               identifies himself as a hacker, explains:

                    I know very little about phones . . . I just
                    hack. See, I can't exactly call these numbers
                    direct.  A lot of people are in the same
                    boat.  In my case, phreaking is a tool, an
                    often used one, but nonetheless a tool (TU,
                    message log, 1988).


                    In the world of the computer underground, the

               ability to "phreak a call" is taken for granted.  The

               invention of the telephone credit card has opened the

               door to wide-scale phreaking.  With these cards, no

               special knowledge or equipment is required to phreak a

               call, only valid credit card numbers, known as "codez,"

               are needed to call any location in the world.  This

               easy access to free long-distance service is

               instrumental for maintaining contact with CU

               participants scattered across the nation.



               Pirating

                    The third major role in the computer underground

               is that of the software pirate.  Software piracy refers

               to the unauthorized copying and distribution of copy-

               righted software.  This activity centers around

               computer bulletin board systems that specialize in

               "warez."7   There pirates can contribute and share
               ____________________

                    7 "Warez" is a common underground term that refers
               to pirated software.

               copies of commercial software. Having access to these

               systems (usually obtained by contributing a copyrighted

               program via a telephone modem) allows the pirate to

               copy, or "download," between two to six programs that

               others have contributed.

                    Software piracy is a growing concern among

               software publishing companies. Some contend that the

               illegal copying of software programs costs the industry

               billions of dollars in lost revenues. Pirates challenge

               this, and claim that in many ways pirating is a hobby,

               much like collecting stamps or baseball cards, and

               their participation actually induces them to spend more

               on software than they would otherwise, even to the

               point of buying software they don't truly need:

                    There's a certain sense of, ahh, satisfaction
                    in having the latest program, or being the
                    first to upload a program on the "want list."
                    I just like to play around with them, see
                    what they can do. If I like something, I'll
                    buy it, or try out several programs like it,
                    then buy one. In fact, if I wasn't pirating,
                    I wouldn't buy any warez, because some of
                    these I buy I do for uploading or just for
                    the fun of it. So I figure the software
                    companies are making money off me, and this
                    is pretty much the same for all the really
                    elite boards, the ones that have the best and
                    most programs. . . . I just bought a $117.
                    program, an accounting program, and I have
                    absolutely no use for it. It's for small
                    businesses.  I thought maybe it would auto-
                    write checks, but it's really a bit too high
                    powered for me. I thought it would be fun to
                    trade to some other boards, but I learned a
                    lot from just looking at it (JX, field notes,
                    1989).

                    Pirates and phreak/hackers do not necessarily

               support the activities of each other, and there is

               distrust and misunderstanding between the two groups.

               At least part of this distrust lies in the

               phreak/hacker perception that piracy is an unskilled

               activity.8  While p/hackers probably don't disapprove

               of piracy as an activity, they nevertheless tend to

               avoid pirate bulletin board systems --partly because

               there is little pertinent phreak/hack information

               contained on them, and partly because of the belief

               that pirates indiscriminately abuse the telephone

               network in pursuit of the latest computer game.  One

               hacker illustrates this belief by theorizing that

               pirates are responsible for a large part of telephone

               credit card fraud.

                    The media claims that it is solely hackers
                    who are responsible for losses pertaining to
                    large telecommunication companies and long
                    distance services.  This is not the case.  We
                    are %hackers% but a small portion of these
                    losses.  The rest are caused by pirates and
                    thieves who sell these codes to people on the
                    street (AF, message log, 1988).

                    Other hackers complained that uploading large
               ____________________

                    8 A possible exception to this are those pirates
               that have the programming skills needed to remove copy
               protection from software.  By removing the program code
               that inhibits duplicate copies from being made these
               individuals, known as "crackers," contribute greatly to
               the easy distribution of "warez."

               programs frequently takes several hours to complete,

               and it is pirate calls, not the ones placed by "tele-

               communications enthusiasts" (a popular euphemism for

               phreakers and hackers) that cost the telephone industry

               large sums of money. However, the data do not support

               the assertation that all pirates phreak their calls.

               Phreaking is considered "very tacky" among elite

               pirates, and system operators (Sysops) of pirate

               bulletin boards discourage phreaked calls because it

               draws attention to the system when the call is

               discovered by the telephone company.

                    Regardless of whether it is the lack of phreak/

               hack skills, the reputation for abusing the network, or

               some other reason, there is indeed a certain amount of

               division between the world of phreakers and hackers and

               that of pirates. The two communities co-exist and share

               resources and methods, but function separately.

                    Social Organization and Deviant Associations

                    Having outlined and defined the activities of the

               computer underground, the question of social

               organization can be addressed.  Joel Best and David

               Luckenbill (1982) have developed a typology for

               identifying the social organization of deviant

               associations.  Essentially they state that deviant

               organizations, regardless of their actual type of

               deviance, will vary in the complexity of their division

               of labor, coordination among organization roles, and

               the purposiveness with which they attempt to achieve

               their goals.  Those organizations which display high

               levels in each of these categories are more

               sophisticated than those with lower levels.

                    Deviants relations with one another can be
                    arrayed along the dimension of organizational
                    sophistication. Beginning with the least
                    sophisticated form, %we% discuss five forms
                    of the social organization of deviants:
                    loners, colleagues, peers, mobs, and formal
                    organizations.  These organization forms are
                    defined in terms of four variables: whether
                    the deviants associate with one another;
                    whether they participate in deviance
                    together; whether their deviance requires an
                    elaborate division of labor; and whether
                    their organization's activities extend over
                    time and space (Best and Luckenbill, 1982,
                    p.24).

               These four variables, also known as mutual association,

               mutual participation, elaborate division of labor, and
^



                                                                    35

               extended organization, are indicators of the social

               organization of deviant groups. The following, taken

               from Best and Luckenbill, illustrates:

               FORM OF       MUTUAL    MUTUAL      DIVISION  EXTENDED
               ORGAN-        ASSOCIA-  PARTICIPA-  OF        ORGAN-
               IZATION       TION      TION        LABOR     IZATION

               Loners         no        no          no        no
               Colleagues     yes       no          no        no
               Peers          yes       yes         no        no
               Mobs           yes       yes         yes       no
               Formal
               Organizations  yes       yes         yes       yes
               _____________________________________________________
                                                       (1982, p.25)


                    Loners do not associate with other deviants,
                    participate in shared deviance, have a
                    division of labor, or maintain their deviance
                    over extended time and space.  Colleagues
                    differ from loners because they associate
                    with fellow deviants. Peers not only
                    associate with one another, but also
                    participate in deviance together.  In mobs,
                    this shared participation requires an
                    elaborate division of labor.  Finally, formal
                    organizations involve mutual association,
                    mutual participation, an elaborate division
                    of labor, and deviant activities extended
                    over time and space (Best and Luckenbill,
                    1982, pp.24-25).

                    The five forms of organizations are presented as

               ideal types, and "organizational sophistication" should

               be regarded as forming a continuum with groups located

               at various points along the range (Best and Luckenbill,

               1982, p.25).  With these two caveats in mind, we begin

               to examine the computer underground in terms of each of

               the four organizational variables. The first level,

               mutual association, is addressed in the following

               section.

                                                                    37





                                 Mutual Association

                    Mutual association is an indicator of

               organizational sophistication in deviant associations.

               Its presence in the computer underground indicates that

               on a social organization level phreak/hackers act as

               "colleagues."  Best and Luckenbill discuss the

               advantages of mutual association for unconventional

               groups:

                    The more sophisticated the form of
                    organization, the more likely the deviants
                    can help one another with their problems.
                    Deviants help one another in many ways: by
                    teaching each other deviant skills and a
                    deviant ideology; by working together to
                    carry out complicated tasks; by giving each
                    other sociable contacts and moral support; by
                    supplying one another with deviant equipment;
                    by protecting each other from the
                    authorities; and so forth.  Just as  %others%
                    rely on one another in the course of everyday
                    life, deviants find it easier to cope with
                    practical problems when they have the help of
                    deviant associates (1982,pp.27-28).


                    Hackers, phreakers, and pirates face practical

               problems. For example, in order to pursue their

               activities they require  equipment9 and knowledge.  The
               ____________________

                    9 The basic equipment consists of a modem, phone
               line, and a computer -- all items that are available
               through legitimate channels.  It is the way the
               equipment is used, and the associated knowledge that is
               required, that distinguishes hackers from other
               computer users.

               problem of acquiring the latter must be solved and,

               additionally, they must devise ways to prevent

               discovery , apprehension and sanctioning by social

               control agents.10

                    One method of solving these problems is to turn to

               other CU members for help and support.  Various means

               of communication have been established that allow

               individuals to interact regardless of their location.

               As might be expected, the communication channels used

               by the CU reflect their interest and ability in high-

               technology, but the technical aspects of these methods

               should not overshadow the mutual association that they

               support.  This section examines the structure  of

               mutual association within the computer underground.

                      The Structure of the Computer Underground

                    Both computer underground communities, the

               p/hackers and the pirates, depend on communications

               technology to provide meeting places for social and

               "occupational" exchanges.  However, phreakers, hackers,

               and pirates are widely dispersed across the country

               and, in many cases, the globe.  In order for the

               communication to be organized and available to

               participants in many time zones and "working" under

               different schedules, centralized points of information

               distribution are required.  Several existing

               technologies --computer bulletin boards, voice mail

               boxes, "chat" lines, and telephone bridges/loops --

               have been adopted by the CU for use as communication

               points. Each of these technologies will be addressed in

               turn, giving cultural insight into CU activities, and

               illustrating mutual association among CU participants.



               Bulletin Board Systems

                    Communication in the computer underground takes

               place largely at night, and primarily through Bulletin

               Board Systems (BBS).  By calling these systems and

               "logging on" with an account and password individuals

               can leave messages to each other, download files and
^



                                                                    40

               programs, and, depending on the number of phone lines

               into the system, type messages to other users that may

               be logged on at the same time.

                    Computer Bulletin Board Systems, or "boards,"  are

               quite common in this computerized age.  Nearly every

               medium-sized city or town has at least one. But not all

               BBS are part of the computer underground culture.  In

               fact, many systems prohibit users from discussing CU

               related activity.  However, since all bulletin boards

               systems essentially function alike it is only the

               content, users, and CU culture that distinguish an

               "underground" from a "legitimate" bulletin board.

                    Computer Underground BBS are generally owned and

               operated by a single person (known as the "system

               operator" or "sysop"). Typically setup in a spare

               bedroom, the costs of running the system are paid by

               the sysop, though some boards solicit donations from

               users. The sysop maintains the board and allocates

               accounts to people who call the system.

                    It is difficult to assess the number of

               underground bulletin boards in operation at any one

               time. BBS in general are transitory in nature, and CU

               boards are no exception to this. Since they are

               operated by private individuals, they are often set up

               and closed down at the whim of the operator. A week

                                                                    41

               that sees two new boards come online may also see

               another close down.  A "lifetime" of anywhere from 1

               month to 1-1/2 years is common for pirate and

               phreak/hack boards.11   One BBS, claimed to be the

               "busiest phreak/hack board in the country" at the

               time,12 operated for less than one year and was

               suddenly closed when the operator was laid off work.

                    Further compounding the difficulty of estimating

               the number of CU boards is their "underground" status.

               CU systems do not typically publicize their existence.

               However, once access to one has been achieved, it is

               easy to learn of other systems by asking users for the

               phone numbers.  Additionally, most BBS maintain lists

               of other boards that users can download or read. So it

               is possible, despite the difficulties, to get a feel

               for the number of CU boards in operation.    Pirate

               boards are the most common of "underground" BBS.  While

               there is no national "directory" of pirate boards,

               there are several listings of numbers for specific
               ____________________

                    11 While some non-CU BBS' have been operating
               since 1981, the longest operating phreak/hack board has
               only been in operation since 1984.


                    12 At it's peak this p/h board was receiving 1000
               calls a month and supported a community of 167 users
               (TP BBS, message log, 1989).

               computer brands.13  One list of Apple pirate boards has

               700 entries. Another, for IBM boards, lists just over

               500.  While there is no way of determining if these

               lists are comprehensive, they provide a minimum

               estimate. Pirate boards for systems other than IBM or

               Apple seem to exhibit similar numbers. David Small, a

               software developer that has taken an aggressive stance

               in closing down pirate boards, estimates that there are

               two thousand in existence at any one time (1988).

               Based on the boards discovered in the course of this

               research, and working from an assumption that each of

               the four major brands of microcomputers have equal

               numbers of pirate boards, two thousand is a reasonable

               estimate.

                    The phreak/hack BBS community is not divided by

               differing brands of micro-computers.  The applicability

               of phreak/hack information to a wide range of systems

               does not require the specialization that pirate boards

               exhibit.  This makes it easier to estimate the number

               of systems in this category.

                    John Maxfield, a computer security consultant, has

               asserted that there are "thousands" of phreak/hack
               ____________________

                    13 Pirate boards are normally "system specific" in
               that they only support one brand or model of
               microcomputer.

               boards in existence (WGN-Radio, November 1988).  The

               data, however, do not confirm this.  A list of

               phreak/hack boards compiled by asking active p/hackers

               and downloading BBS lists from known phreak/hack

               boards, indicates that there are probably no more than

               one hundred.  Experienced phreak/hackers say that the

               quality of these boards varies greatly, and of those

               that are in operation today only a few (less than ten)

               attract the active and knowledgeable user.

                    Right after "War Games" came out there must
                    have been hundreds of hacker bulletin boards
                    spring up. But 99% of those were lame. Just a
                    bunch of dumb kids that saw the movie and
                    spent all there %sic% time asking "anyone got
                    any k00l numberz?" instead of actually
                    hacking on anything. But for a while there
                    was %sic% maybe ten systems worth calling . .
                    . where you could actually learn something
                    and talk to people who knew what was going
                    Nowadays %sic% there are maybe three that I
                    consider good . . . and about four or five
                    others that are okay.  The problem is that
                    anybody can set up a board with a k-rad name
                    and call it a hacker board and the media/feds
                    will consider it one if it gets busted. But
                    it never really was worth a shit from the
                    beginning.(TP2, field notes, 1989)


                    Towards a BBS Culture.  Defining and identifying

               CU boards can be problematic.  The lack of an ideal

               type undoubtedly contributes to the varying estimates

               of the number of CU bulletin board systems. While

               developing such a typology is not the intent of this

               work, it is appropriate to examine the activities and

                                                                    44

               characteristics exhibited by BBS supporting the pirate

               and phreak/hack communities.  While much of the culture

               of pirate and phreak/hack worlds overlap, there are

               some differences in terms of how the BBS medium is used

               to serve their interests. We begin with a short

               discussion of the differences between the two

               communities, then discuss cultural characteristics

               common to all CU BBS systems.

                    All BBS feature a "files area" where programs and

               text files are available for downloading by users.

               Initially these programs/files are supplied by the

               system operator, but as the board grows they are

               contributed (called "uploading") by callers. The

               content and size of the files area differs according to

               whether the board supports the pirate or phreak/hack

               community.

                    The files area on a pirate board consists

               primarily of programs and program documentation.

               Normally these programs are for only one brand of

               micro-computer (usually the same as the system is being

               run on). Text files on general or non-computer topics

               are uncommon.  A "files area" menu from a pirate BBS

               illustrates the emphasis on software:

                    %1% Documentation        %2% Telecommunications
                    %3% Misc Applications    %4% Word Processing

                    The "files area" on a phreak/hack BBS is

               noticeably smaller than it is on pirate systems.  It

               consists primarily of instructional files (known as "g-

               files" for "general files") and copies of phreak/hack

               newsletters and journals.  Pirated commercial software

               is very rare; any programs that are available are

               usually non-copyrighted specialized programs used to

               automate the more mundane aspects of phreaking or

               hacking. It is not uncommon to find them in forms

               usable by different brands of computers.  A "files

               area" list from a phreak/hack BBS is listed here

                    The difference in files area size is consistent

               with the activities of pirates and phreak/hackers.  The

               main commodity of exchange between pirates is, as

               discussed earlier, copyrighted software thus accounting

               for the heavy use of that area of the board that

               permits exchange of programs.  The phreak/hackers, on

               the other hand, primarily exchange information about

               outside systems and techniques.  Their interests are

               better served by the "message bases" of BBS.

                    The "message bases" (areas where callers leave

               messages to other users) are heavily used on

               phreak/hack systems. The  messages are not specific to

               one brand of micro-computer due to the fact that not

               all users own the same equipment. Rather than focus on

               the equipment owned by the phreak/hacker, the messages

               deal with their "targets."  Everything from

               phreak/hacking techniques to CU gossip is discussed. On

                                                                    47

               some boards all the messages, regardless of topic, are

               strung together in one area.  But on others there are

               separate areas dealing with specific networks and

               mainframe computers:

                    Message Boards available:

                     1 : General

                    The pirate community, on the other hand, makes

               little use of the "message bases." Most users prefer to

               spend their time (which may be limited by the system

               operator on a per day or per call basis) uploading

               and/or downloading files rather than leaving messages

               for others.  Those messages that do exist are usually

               specific to the pirating enterprise such as help with

               programs on the board, requests for specific programs

               ("want lists"), and notices about other pirate bulletin

               boards that users may want to call. Occasional

               discussion of phreaking may occur, but the emphasis is

                                                                    48

               on techniques used to make free calls, not technical

               network discussions as often occurs on phreak/hack

               systems.  A list of message areas from a large pirate

               BBS illustrates the emphasis on the pirating

               enterprise.  A message area for general discussions has

               been created, but those areas devoted to pirating

               display more use:

                    Area %2% Pirating Only!!         75 messages
                    Area %3ic

               BBS can be considered to be a "community" of loosely

               associated individuals by virtue of their "membership"

               in the BBS.

                    Additionally, the system itself, serving either

               pirates or phreak/hackers, exists within a loose

               network of other bulletin boards that serve these same

               interests. It is within this larger community where

               pirate and phreak/hack boards seem to differ.

                    Due to the brand-specific nature of pirate boards,

               there is not a strong network between pirate BBS that
^



                                                                    49

               operate on other systems.  This is understandable as a

               pirate that owned an Apple computer would have little

               use for the programs found on an IBM board.  However,

               this creates separate communities of active pirates,

               each loosely associated with other users of their

               computer type, but with little or no contact with

               pirate communities on other systems.

                    There is, however, a degree of cohesiveness among

               pirate boards that support the same micro-computers.

               While the users may be different on systems, the data

               shows that some pirate boards are "networked" with each

               other via special software that allows messages and

               files to be automatically shared between different

               boards.  Thus a message posted on a west coast pirate

               board will be automatically copied on an east coast BBS

               later that night. In a like manner, software programs

               can be sent between "networked" boards.  The extent of

               this network is unknown.

                    The pirate BBS community also exhibits

               cohesiveness in the form of "co-sysops."  As discussed

               earlier, sysops are the system operators and usually

               owners of BBS.  On some pirate boards, "co-sysop"

               distinction is given to an operator of another board,

               often located in another state. This forms a loose

               network of "sister boards" where the sysop of one has
^



                                                                    50

               co-sysop privileges on the other.   However, this

               cooperative effort appears to be limited mainly to the

               system operators as comparing user lists from sister

               boards shows little overlap between the regular

               callers. How co-sysop positions are utilized is

               unknown, and it is suspected that they are largely

               honorary.  But nonetheless it is indicative of mutual

               association between a small number of boards.

                     The phreak/hack board community does not exhibit

               the same brand-specific division as the pirate

               community.  Unlike the divided community of pirates,

               phreak/hackers appear to maintain contacts throughout

               the country.  Obtaining and comparing user lists from

               several phreak/hack BBS reveals largely the same group

               of people using several different boards across the

               country.14 While phreak/hack boards have yet to adopt

               the "networking" software used by pirate boards, an

               active group of phreak/hackers is known to use the

               sophisticated university mainframe computer network,

               called Bitnet, to exchange phreak/hack newsletters and

               gossip.

                    14 In fact, users lists from phreak/hack BBSs
               located in Europe and Australia show that many U.S.
               p/hackers utilize these systems as well.

               and phreak/hack boards, their cultures are remarkably

               similar. Any discussion of the computer underground

               must include both communities.  Additionally, a

               formulation of the culture of CU BBS must address the

               means in which access to the board, and thus deviant

               associates, is obtained.

                    For a caller to successfully enter the CU BBS

               community, he must display an awareness of CU culture

               and technical skill in the CU enterprise. If the caller

               fails to exhibit cultural knowledge, then access to the

               board is unlikely to be granted.  The ways in which

               this cultural knowledge is obtained and displayed

               illustrates the social nature of the CU and further

               displays some of the subcultural norms of behavior.

                    On most "licit" (non-underground) boards,

               obtaining permission to use the system is accomplished

               by logging on and providing a name and home phone

               number to the system operator (sysop).  Sysop's

               normally do not check the validity of the information,

               and once a caller has provided it he or she is granted

               full access to the system.  There is normally one level

               of access for all users, with only the sysop having

               more "powerful" access.

                    Obtaining access to underground bulletin boards is

               more complicated and requires more steps to complete.

                                                                    52

               In an attempt to prevent law enforcement agents

               ("feds") from obtaining accounts on systems where

               pirates or p/hackers are vulnerable, if not to actual

               arrest, then at least to exposing their latest act-

               ivities and methods, sysop's of illicit boards attempt

               to limit access to the system.

                    One method of doing this is to restrict

               publicizing the existence of the board.  Computer

               underground BBS are not normally included in BBS

               listings found in computer books and magazines, and

               there is a norm, particularly strong on p/hack systems,

               that the boards are not to be mentioned on non-CU

               systems.  There are, however, some "entry-level" CU BBS

               that are fairly well known.  These systems are known as

               "anarchist" boards.

                    "Anarchist" boards, while exhibiting many of the

               same characteristics as pirate and phreak/hack boards,

               are really a cross between the two and serve primarily

               as social outlets for both pirates and phreak/hackers.

               The message areas on "anarchist" boards are quite

               active, "chatty" messages are not discouraged. Indeed

               there are normally  several different message areas

               devoted to a wide range of topics including everything

               from "skipping school" to "punk rock." The files area

               contains both warez (but normally only the newest

                                                                    53

               games, and specific to the computer system that the

               board runs on) and phreak/hack text files.  Neither

               collection is as extensive as it would be on pirate-

               only or p/hack-only systems.

                    The data suggest that one function of "anarchist"

               boards is to introduce newcomers to the culture of the

               computer underground. By acting as "feeder boards,"

               they can provide preliminary socialization and

               instruction for CU behavior and techniques.

               Additionally, "anarchist" boards frequently provide

               areas where phone numbers to pirate and p/hack systems

               can be traded, thus providing systems where more in-

               depth information, and other contacts, can be found.  A

               phreak/hacker describes how an "anarchist" board was

               instrumental in introducing him to the computer

               underground:

                    I've been phreaking and hacking for about
                    four years now.  I discovered phreaking on my
                    own at this place I used to work.  We had
                    this small LD %long distance% provider that
                    used codez so I started hacking them out and
                    calling places myself . . . but I didn't know
                    no other phreaks at that time.  Then I
                    started using the codez to call boards from
                    home on my computer. Somebody gave me the
                    number to Jack Black's Whore House %an
                    "anarchy board"% and I started learning about
                    hacking and shit from the people and philes
                    they had there. Then one day this guy, King
                    Hammer, sent me some e-mail %a private
                    message% and told me to call his system.
                    That's where I really learned my way around
                    the nets and shit.  You could ask questions
                    and people would help you out and stuff. If I

                    hadn't found out some of the tricks that I
                    did I probably would have got busted by now.
                    (TP2, field notes, 1989)

                    Once an individual has obtained the telephone

               number to a CU BBS, through whatever channels, callers

               follow essentially the same procedure as they do on

               licit systems . . . that of calling and logging on.

               However, since "underground" boards are not truly

               underground (that is, totally secret) first-time

               callers are not given access to the board itself. When

               a user is unable to provide an already valid

               username/password, the system will automatically begin

               its registration procedure.   First, the caller is

               asked to enter a "username" (the name used by the

               system to distinguish between callers) and "phone

               number."  These first system requests, normally seen

               only as "Enter Your Name and Phone Number," serve as

               partial screens to keep out non-underground callers

               that may have happened across the board.  The way that

               a user responds to these questions indicates if they

               have cultural knowledge of the CU. The  norm is to

               enter a pseudonym and a fake phone number.15 If a
               ____________________

                    15 A functional reason for this norm is that
               usernames and telephone numbers are stored on the
               computer as part of the BBS system files.  Should the
               BBS ever be seized in legal proceedings, this list of
               names and numbers (and on some systems addresses . . .
               which are also normally false) could be used to
               identify the users of the system.

               caller enters his or her real name (or at least a name

               that does not appear to be a pseudonym) the system

               operator will be put on guard that the caller may not

               be aware of the type of board that he has called, for

               the pseudonym is the most visible of CU cultural

               traits.

                    All members of the underground adopt "handles" to

               protect their identity.  The pseudonyms become second

               identities and are used to log onto bulletin boards,

               and as  "signatures" on messages and instructional text

               files.16  They are not unlike those adopted by

               citizens-band radio users, and reflect both the humor

               and technical orientation of computer underground

               participants.  A review of handles used by phreakers,

               hackers, and pirates finds that they fall into three

               broad categories: figures from literature, films, and

               entertainment (often science fiction); names that play

               upon computers and related technologies; and

               nouns/descriptive names.  (See Appendix A for fictional

               examples of each.)

               individuals retain their handles over time.

                                                                    56

               password to be used for future calls, the caller is

               asked several more questions designed to screen users

               and determine initial access privileges.  Unlike licit

               boards, underground BBS may have several different

               levels of access with only the most trusted users being

               able to read messages and get files in "elite" or "high

               access" areas that are unknown and unavailable to other

               callers.  In many cases, pirate boards are able to

               operate "above ground"  and appear to be open-public

               access systems unless callers have the proper

               privileges to access the areas where the "good stuff"

               is located.  The answers given to access questionnaires

               determine whether a caller will receive access to some,

               all, or none of the higher levels.

                    These questionnaires frequently ask for "personal

               references" and a list of other boards the caller has

               "high access" on.  The question is vague, and random

               callers are unlikely to answer it correctly.  However,

               if the caller lists pseudonyms of other CU members that

               are known and trustworthy to the sysop, as well as some

               other boards that are known to have "good users" and

               "good security" access will usually be granted.17  If

               all the answers are relevant and indicative of CU
               ____________________

                    17 The data suggest that personal references are
               only checked if something seems unusual or suspicious.

               knowledge, then initial access is normally granted.

                    Other methods of controlling access include

               presenting a "quiz" to determine if the technical

               knowledge of the user is up to par with the expertise

               expected on the boards.18  Some systems, instead of a

               quiz, ask the user to write a short statement (100

               words or less) about why they want access, where they

               got the phone number to the system, and what they can

               provide to other users. Some pirate boards come right

               out and ask the user to supply a list of the good

               "warez" that they can upload and what they are looking

               to download. If the caller fails to list recent

               copyrighted programs then it is evident that they are

               unaware of the nature of the BBS:

                    I had this one dude call up and he told me in
                    his message that he was looking for some
                    "good games."  So instead of giving him
                    access I just left him some e-mail %a private
                    message%.  I asked what kind of games he was
                    looking for. Next time he called he wrote
                    back and said "a public domain Asteroids
                    game."  I couldn't believe it. Not only is
                    Asteroids so damn old it's lame, but this guy
                    is looking for pd %public domain% shit.  No
                    way was he going to get access. He didn't
                    even know what this board is. I left him a
                    message telling him that I didn't have one.
                    He never called back after that (CH, sysop of
                    a pirate BBS, field notes, 1988).

                                                                    58

                    Ironically, the pseudo-elaborate security methods

               of underground boards, while they may be effective in

               keeping off random non-CU callers, are not effective in

               screening out "feds." Data and media accounts show that

               boards are regularly infiltrated by telephone security

               personnel and software companies. Also, the adoption of

               handles to protect identities is defeated by the

               consistent use of the same handle over time. But in

               order to obtain and maintain status and prestige in the

               CU one must keep the same pseudonym in order to

               (literally) "make a name for oneself." The fact that CU

               communication is not face-to-face requires a consistent

               means of identifying oneself to others.  The handle

               fulfills this purpose but at the same time becomes as

               attached to a single individual as a real name would.

               The access rituals of the computer underground, which

               are contingent on being a "known" pirate or

               phreak/hacker, make changing handles unproductive.

                    The life blood and center of the computer under-

               ground is the bulletin board network.  Acting as both

               the main trade center of performance related tools and

               innovations and as a means of socialization, the

               underground could not exist without the BBS network.

               They serve to "recruit" and educate newcomers and

               provide a way to traffic in information and software.

                                                                    59

               The pirating enterprise in particular is very dependent

               upon the BBS as they are the very means by which

               "warez" are traded.  For the phreak/hacker community,

               BBS provide a means of trading the resources of system

               numbers and passwords, as well as instructional texts

               on techniques.  The access process serves as evidence

               of mutual association amongst phreakers, hackers, and

               pirates as cultural knowledge is needed as well as

               personal references (evidence of acceptance and access

               to others).

                    The CU bulletin board systems are unique in that

               they provide a way to exchange information with a large

               number of others.  The other methods of CU commun-

               ication are based on conversations rather than written

               texts and thus are much less permanent.  These methods,

               discussed next, are telephone bridges/loops, voice mail

               boxes, and computer "chat" systems.



               Bridges, Loops, and Voice Mail Boxes

                    Of the additional means of communication used by

               the CU, telephone "bridges" and "loops" are most

               common.  Unlike BBS, which require data links provided

               by a computer and modem, bridges and loops are "old

               fashioned" voice connections.  Since they can not

               accommodate the transfer of programs or files they are

               used primarily by phreakers and hackers, and most often

                                                                    60

               as a social/recreational outlet.

                    A "bridge" is a technical name for what is

               commonly known as a "chat line" or "conference system."

               They are familiar to the  public as the pay-

               per-minute group conversation systems advertised on

               late night television.  Many bridge systems are owned

               by large corporations who maintain them for business

               use during the day.  While the numbers to these systems

               is not public knowledge, many of them have been

               discovered by phreaks who then utilize the systems

               during the night.

                    In addition to these pre-existing conference

               systems, phreakers have become skilled at  arranging

               for a temporary, private bridge to be created via

               AT&T's conference calling facilities.  This allows for

               conversations to be held among a self-selected group of

               One p/hacker will initiate the conference and call
               others at home to add them to the conference.  As more
               people join they suggest others to add. The initiator
               can temporarily jump out of the conference, call the
               new person and solicit their attendance. If they don't
               want to join or aren't home, the initiator simply
               returns to the conference without adding them in.

                    participated with over a bridge occurred
                    about 2 months ago on an AT&T Quorum where
                    all we did was engineer 3/way %calls% and
                    restrict ourselves to purely technical infor-

                    the need occurred. Don't let the kids ruin
                    all the fun and convenience of bridges.
                    Lameness is one thing, practicality is
                    another (DC, message log, 1988).


                    In addition to setting up "private" bridges,

               p/hackers can utilize "loop lines" in a further attempt

               to limit the number of eavesdroppers on their

               conversations. Unlike bridges, which connect a

               virtually unlimited number of callers at once, "loops"

               are limited to just two people at a time.

                    "Loop lines" are actually telephone company test

               lines installed for internal use.21  A loop consists of

               two separate telephone numbers that connect only to

               each other. Each end has a separate phone number, and

               when each person calls one end, they are connected to

               each other automatically.  This allows for individuals

               the touch tone sounds used to dial phone numbers.


                    21 These test lines are discovered by phreaks and
               hackers by programming their home computer to dial
               numbers at random and "listen" for the distinctive tone
               that an answering loop makes, by asking sympathetic
               telephone company employees, or through information
               contained on internal company computers.

               to hold private conversations without divulging their

               location or identity by exchanging telephone numbers.

                    Finally, voice mail boxes ("VMB") are another

               means of communicating with individual actors. There

               are several commercial voice mail box systems located

               throughout the country.  They function similar to a

               telephone answering machine in that callers can call

               in, listen to a recorded message, and then leave a

               message for the box owner. Many of these systems are

               accessible via toll-free telephone numbers. The

               security of some VMB systems is notoriously poor. Many

               phreaks have expertise in "creating" boxes for

               themselves that are unknown (until discovered) by the

               owner of the system. However, these boxes are usually

               short lived since discovery by the system operator, and

               closure of the box, is only a matter of time. But as

               long as the box is functioning, it can serve as a means

               of communicating with others.  VMB numbers are

               frequently posted on bulletin boards with invitations

               to "call if you have any good stuff."  They are often

               used by pirates to exchange messages about new releases

               of software, and by phreak/hackers to trade account and

               access numbers.  Additionally, some of the underground

               newsletters and journals obtain boxes so users can call

               in news of arrests and other gossip.

                    Like bulletin boards, VMBs are systems that allow

               information to be disseminated to a large number of

               associates, and unlike the live telephone conversations

               of bridges and loops, they are available at any time of

               the day.  Additionally, VMB's don't require use of a

               computer and modem, only a touch tone phone is needed

               to call the box.  Their usefulness is limited somewhat

               because they play only one "outgoing" message at a

               time, and their transitory nature limits their

               reliability.



               Summary

                    Phreakers, hackers and pirates do not act as

               loners.  They have adopted existing methods of

               communication, consistent with their skills in high

               technology, to form a social network that allows for

               the exchange of information, the socialization of new

               members, socializing with others, and in the case of

               pirates, performing the "deviant" act itself via these

               means.

                    These communication points create and foster

               groups of loosely associated individuals, with specific

               interests, coming together to exchange information

               and/or software. It is impossible to be a part of the

               social network of the computer underground and be a

               loner.   Based upon the Best and Luckenbill measure,

                                                                    64

               actors in the computer underground, by displaying

               mutual association, organize as colleagues.

                    The social network of the computer underground

               provides the opportunity for colleagues to form

               cooperative working relationships with others, thus

               moving the CU towards a more sophisticated form of

               social organization.  These "hacker groups" are

               addressed in the next section.

                                                                    65





                                Mutual Participation

                    In the previous chapter the ways in which the

               structure of the computer underground fosters mutual

               association  were discussed. Their social outlets and

               means for informational exchange bring the CU community

               together as deviant colleagues.  Their relationships

               fit quite well into the Best and Luckenbill (1982)

               typology of collegial associations:

                    The relationship between deviant colleagues
                    involves limited contact.  Like loners,
                    colleagues perform their deviant acts alone.
                    But unlike loners colleagues associate with
                    one another when they are not engaged in
                    deviance . . . In effect, there is a division
                    between two settings; onstage where
                    individual performs alone; and backstage,
                    where colleagues meet (cf Goffman).  In their
                    backstage meetings, colleagues discuss
                    matters of common interest, including
                    techniques for performing effectively, common
                    problems and how to deal with them, and ways
                    of coping with the outside world (1982 p.37).

                    However, despite the advantages of collegial

               association, ties between CU participants are weak.

               Loyalty between individuals seems rare, as the CU is

               replete with tales of phreak/hackers who, when

               apprehended, expose identities or "trade secrets" in

               order to avoid prosecution.  These weak collegial ties

               may be fostered by the anonymity of CU communication

               methods, and the fact that all CU actors are, to some
^



                                                                    66

               extent, in competition with each other. There are only

               so many systems with weak security and once such a

               system is found, sharing it with others will virtually

               ensure that the hole will be sealed when the increased

               activity is noticed.  Thus while p/hackers will share

               general knowledge with each other, specific information

               is not disseminated publicly.

                    As Best and Luckenbill have observed, in order to

               remain in a collegial relationship individuals must be

               able to successfully carry out operations alone (1982

               p.45). In order to sustain a career in p/hacking one

               must pursue and collect information independent of what

               is shared on the communication channels.  Despite the

               association with other phreakers and hackers, the

               actual performance of the phreak/hacking act is a

               solitary activity.22

                    That is not to say, however, that p/hackers never

               share specific information with others.  As discussed

               earlier, p/hack bulletin board systems frequently have

               differentiated levels of access where only highly

               regarded individuals are able to leave and read

               messages. These areas are frequently used to keep
               ____________________

                    22 This does not hold true for pirates. By
               definition they must trade programs with other
               individuals.

               information from "unskilled" users at the lower levels.

               There are strong social norms that some information

               should not be shared too widely, as it may be either

               "abused" or fall into the hands of enforcement agents.

               For example, when one p/hacker announced that he was

               going to release a tutorial on how to infiltrate a new

               telephone company computer, he received the following

               messages in reply:

                    Not smart, DT. %That computer% is a system
                    which can be quite powerful if used to its
                    potential. I don't think that information on
                    programming the switches should be released
                    to anyone. Do you realize how destructive
                    %that computer% could really be if used by
                    someone who is irresponsible and intends on
                    destroying things? Don't even think about
                    releasing that file. If you do release that
                    file, it will disappear and will no longer
                    remain in circulation. Believe me. Not many
                    have the right to know about %that computer%,
                    or any other delicate telco computers for
                    that matter. Why do you think the fucking New
                    York Times published that big article on
                    hackers screwing around with telco machines?
                    Not only will you get into a lot of trouble
                    by releasing that file on %computer%, you
                    will be making telcos more aware of what is
                    actually happening, and soon no one will be
                    able to learn about their systems. Just think
                    twice (EP, message log, 1988).

                    Why would you want normal people to have such
                    knowledge? Any why would you post about it?
                    If you have knowledge that's fine but DON'T
                    spread that knowledge among others that may
                    abuse it. It's not impressive! I don't know
                    why anyone would want to disperse that
                    knowledge. Please don't release any "in
                    depth" files on such systems of great power.
                    Keep that to yourself it will just mess it up
                    for others (UU, message log, 1988).

                                                                    68


                    The desire to share information with selected

               colleagues often leads to the formation of cooperative

               "working groups." These partnerships are easily formed,

               as the structure of mutual association in the CU

               creates a means where "talent" can be judged on the

               basis of past interactions, longevity in the field, and

               mutual interests. When allegiances are formed, the CU

               actors begin "mutual participating" in their acts, thus

               becoming "peers" in terms of social organization.

                    Mutual participation, as defined in the Best and

               Luckenbill typology, is exhibited by actors sharing in

               the same deviant act, in the physical presence of one

               another (1982 p.45).  However, the measurement was

               "grounded" in studies of traditional deviant

               associations (eg:  street gangs, prostitutes, etc.)

               where "real-time" interaction is common. The technology

               used by the CU negates this requirement as actors can

               be located in different parts of the country.

               Additionally, "hacking" on a system, by a group of

               peers, does not require simultaneous participation by

               all members.  However Best and Luckenbill's typology is

               an ideal type, and the activities of peers in the

               computer underground do not fall outside of the spirit

               or intention of their concept of mutual participation.

               Their description of deviant peer associations is
^



                                                                    69

               presented here:

                    Deviant peers are distinguished from
                    colleagues by their shared participation in
                    deviance.  While colleagues carry out their
                    deviant operations alone, peers commit
                    deviant acts in one another's presence.
                    Peers cooperate in carrying out deviant
                    operations, but they have a minimal division
                    of labor, with each individual making roughly
                    comparable contribution.  Peer relationships
                    also tend to be egalitarian and informal;
                    some peers may be acknowledged leaders or
                    admired for their skill, but there is no set
                    division of authority.  Like colleagues,
                    peers share subcultural knowledge, but peer
                    groups typically provide their members with
                    more support.  In addition to cooperating in
                    deviant operations, peers may recruit and
                    socialize newcomers and supply one another
                    with deviant equipment and social support.
                    Thus, the bonds between peers are stronger
                    than those linking colleagues (1982, p.45).

                    Peer associations in the CU are largely limited to

               small groups23 working on a specified goal.  Both

               pirates and p/hackers organize themselves in this

               regard, though their characteristics differ.  We begin

               with a discussion of mutual participation among

               pirates.



               Pirate Groups

                    Pirate groups are composed of less than ten

                    23 In terms of the ideal type for deviant peers
               any two individuals working in cooperation exhibit
               mutual participation. The discussion here addresses
               groups that consist of three or more people that
               identify themselves as a sort of "club." Short-lived
               interaction between two people is not considered a
               "group" in the CU culture.

               members.  Their primary purpose is to obtain the latest

               software, remove any copy-protection from it, and then

               distribute it to the pirate community.  Often the

               "warez" that they distribute will be adorned with the

               group name, so subsequent users will be aware of the

               source of the software.  Many pirate groups have "home"

               BBS systems that act as key distribution points, and as

               places where outsiders can communicate with members of

               the association. This researcher was unable to obtain

               data about the internal organization of pirate groups,

               but it appears that they are leaderless, with

               individual members working alone but giving credit to

               the group as a whole.



               Phreak/hack groups

               The existence of phreak/hacker groups is well

               documented in the data, and has been heavily reported

               in the media.  Two hacker groups in particular, The

               414's (named for the Wisconsin area code in which they

               lived), and The Inner Circle, received a large amount

               of press after being apprehended for various computer

               break-ins.  However, the "threat" that such groups

               represent has probably been overstated as the data

               indicate that "hacker gangs" vary greatly in

               organization and dedication to the CU enterprise.

                    Many hacker groups are short-lived associations of

               convenience, much like the "no girls allowed!" clubs

               formed by young boys.  They often consist of four to

               nine beginning phreak/hackers who will assist each

               other in obtaining telephone credit-card numbers. By

               pooling their resources, a large number of illicit

               "codez" can be obtained and shared with others.

               Distribution of the account numbers is not limited to

               the group, they are often shared with the community at

               large, "courtesy of Codez Kidz Ltd." Groups of this

               type are looked at with disdain by "elite"

               phreak/hackers and are often criticized as being more

               interested in self-promotion then they are with

               actually phreaking or hacking.

                    Some hacker groups are very proficient and

               dedicated to their craft, however. These groups are

               characterized by smaller memberships, less visibility

               to non-members, and commitment to the CU enterprise.

               They are loosely organized, yet some have managed to

               exist six or more years despite members dropping out or

               being arrested. These "elite" groups are selective

               about membership, and cite trust and talent as the two

               leading requirements for joining:

                    The group exists mainly for information
                    trading. If you trust everyone else in the
                    group, it is very profitable to pool
                    information on systems . . . also it is nice
                    to know someone that you can call if you need
                    help on operating system X and to have people
^



                                                                    72

                    feel free to call you if they need help on
                    operating system Y (AN, message log, 1988).

                    Trust is a very important part of a group. I
                    think that's blatantly obvious. You have to
                    be able to trust the other members of the
                    group with the information you are providing
                    in order to be productive, and have a secure
                    situation (UU, message log, 1988).

                    . . . all groups serve the same purpose: to
                    make their members feel better about
                    themselves (like, wow, I'm in a group) and to
                    trade things, whether it's wares, codes, or
                    whatever. But the thing is that being in a
                    group is like saying "I trust you, so like,
                    what can we do together?" (NN, message log,
                    1988)

                    Indeed, hacker groups are formed primarily for the

               purpose of information exchange.  To this end, groups

               attempt to recruit members with a wide variety of

               "specializations" in order to have a better support

               network to turn to:

                    %Our group% has always been very selective
                    about members (took me six years to get in).
                    The only reason the group exists is to bring
                    together a diverse group of talents. There is
                    very little overlap in %the group% these
                    days.  Everyone has one thing that they are
                    the best in the country at, and are
                    conversant with just about any other form of
                    hacking.  As an example, I got into a Primos
                    computer this morning around 9 am. Once I got
                    in, I know enough about Primos to get around,
                    but that's it. So I call %PS% in New York,
                    give him the info, and when I get home
                    tonight, he has gotten in and decrypted the
                    entire username/password file and uploaded it
                    to me.  But two weeks ago he got into a VAX.
                    He got the account to me, I called it up and
                    set up three backdoors into the system that
                    we can get in if the account is detected or
                    deleted.  Simple matter of communism.  From
                    each according to his ability . . . etc. Also

                                                                    73

                    it helps that everyone in the group is
                    experienced enough that they don't fuck up
                    accounts you spend all day getting (TM, field
                    notes, 1989).

                    Consistent with the Best and Luckenbill ideal

               type, hacker groups do not exhibit a set division of

               authority or labor. Most groups are leaderless, and

               every member is free to pursue their own interests,

               involving other members of the group only when desired:

                    We just got our group together.  We've got a
                    guy that does VMB's and a Sprinter %obtains
                    "codez" from U.S. Sprint% and a couple of
                    hackers.  Everybody's free to pursue whatever
                    system they want but if they want or need
                    some help they can call on any of the other
                    members if they want to. Like if one guy is
                    scanning and finds a VAX he might call and
                    give me the dialup.  Then I might have to
                    call our Sprinter to get some codez so I can
                    start hacking on it.  Once I get through I'll
                    give the account to the other members.  But
                    if I found it myself I wouldn't have to give
                    it out but I probably would anyway 'cuz
                    keeping it would be bullshit (DC, field
                    notes, 1988).

                    There isn't a leader really.  The guy who
                    starts the group sort of acts like a contact
                    point but everyone else has everyones' phone
                    number and you can call whoever you want to
                    anytime.  Usually when you're putting a group
                    together you just get everyone you want and
                    you all decide on a name. (DC, field notes,
                    1988).



               Summary

                    By virtue of the extensive social network found in

               the CU, some participants form work groups.  The

               sophistication of these groups varies, but in all cases
^



                                                                    74

               it is evident that the groups exist to support what are

               primarily individually performed activities.  The

               groups exhibit many of the ideal-type characteristics

               of peer associations, and it is clear that in some

               cases the computer underground is socially organized as

               peers.

                                                                    75





                                     Conclusion

                    Phreakers, hackers, and pirates do not act as

               loners.  Loners do not associate with others, and are

               on their own in coping with the practical problems

               presented by their activities (Best and Luckenbill

               1982, p.28).  From the data presented here, it is

               evident that the computer underground has established

               an extensive social network for the exchange of

               resources and mutual support.  The characteristics of

               the CU varies according to the goals of the

               participants, but the presence of mutual association is

               consistent. Contact between individuals is limited,

               with the acts of phreaking or hacking being committed

               alone.  Computer underground participants do associate

               with one another in order to discuss matters of common

               interest, such as performance techniques, news, and

               problem solving.  To facilitate this informational

               exchange, they have established a technologically

               sophisticated network that utilizes computer bulletin

               boards, voice mail boxes, telephone bridges, and

               telephone loops.

                    The collegial organization of the computer

               underground is further evidenced by the establishment

               of a CU culture. The subcultural adaptation of

                                                                    76

               language, expectations of normative conduct, and status

               stratification based on mastery of cultural knowledge

               and skill, all indicate that the computer underground

               is, at the very least, a social organization of

               colleagues (see Best and Luckenbill, 1982, p.37).

                    The very structure that permits mutual association

               among CU participants also encourages some to form

               working relationships, thus acting as peers by mutually

               participating in CU activities. Peers organized in this

               manner share in their deviance, organizing informally

               with little division of labor or set division of

               authority (Best and Luckenbill, 1982, p.45).  These

               peer associations provide support to members, and can

               provide socialization and recruitment functions for

               newcomers. The establishment of work groups, through

               mutual participation, indicates that though the

               computer underground is largely organized as a network

               of colleagues, it is also, to some degree, a social

               organization of peers.

                    Best and Luckenbill (1982) describe two additional

               forms of deviant associations that are more

               organizationally sophisticated than peers: "mobs" and

               "formal organizations." The computer underground,

               however, does not display the requisite characteristics

               of these organizational types.  The primary
^



                                                                    77

               characteristic of "mobs" is an elaborate division of

               labor (Best and Luckenbill, 1982, p.25).  While some CU

               groups do exhibit a rudimentary division of labor based

               on individual members' specialization, it is not by any

               means "elaborate."  Any division of labor that does

               exist is voluntary and arises on the basis of

               specialized knowledge, not a specialized organizational

               role.

                    In much the same manner the lack of a designated

               leader or leadership hierarchy prevents CU groups from

               being categorized as "formal organizations" in the Best

               and Luckenbill typology.  Deviant organizations at this

               level are quite sophisticated and there is no empirical

               evidence that the computer underground is organized in

               this manner.

                    This study of the computer underground has been a

               test of the Best and Luckenbill typology of the social

               organization of deviants.  As a test of their

               organizational indicators, the CU has shown that the

               categories are well constructed, with the possible

               exception of limiting "mutual participation" to acts

               carried out in the presence of others.  However, if we

               modify this to include non-simultaneous, but

               cooperative, acts as found in phreak/hacker groups, the

               category is otherwise robust.  The flexibility of the
^



                                                                    78

               typology, which explicitly recognizes that not all

               deviant associations will display all of the character-

               istics (Best and Luckenbill, 1982, p.25), is a strength

               that allowed it to be easily used in terms of the

               computer underground.

                    By addressing the CU from a social organizational

               viewpoint we have seen that despite the high technology

               trappings of their craft, pirates, phreakers, and

               hackers display organizational characteristics found in

               other groups that have been criminalized.  This may

               suggest that the development of sophisticated tools to

               commit "crime" does not necessarily affect the ways in

               which individuals organize their activities.

                    The implications of peer and collegial

               organization for the members of the computer

               underground are vast.  The level of sophistication has

               a direct relationship to the types of resources on

               which individuals can draw (Best and Luckenbill, 1982,

               p.54).  Because CU members are mutually associated,

               they are able to turn to colleagues for advice and

               support with various problems.  However, at the

               collegial level they are left to enact the solutions

               independently.  Whether or not they are successful in

               doing so will determine if they choose to remain active

               in the computer underground.  The data show that
^



                                                                    79

               involvement in the CU is short in duration, unless

               success in early phreak/hack attempts is obtained.  As

               long as the CU remains organized as a collection of

               colleagues, this trend will continue.  Additionally, as

               the computer and telephone industries become more

               sophisticated in preventing the unauthorized use of

               their facilities, new phreak/hackers are unlikely to

               succeed in their initial attempts at the act, thus

               dropping away from the activity and never becoming

               acculturated to the point where peer relationships can

               be developed.

                    At the peer level, a dimension of sophistication

               that some members of the CU do display, the knowledge

               and resources to solve problems and obtain resources is

               greater.  However, even at this level the ties between

               peers remain weak at best.  Although their cooperative

               ties allow for more sophisticated operations, and

               somewhat reduce the CU's vulnerability to social

               control agents (Best and Luckenbill, 1982, p.53), it

               still does not completely eliminate the need for

               individual success in order to sustain a CU career.  As

               long as the CU remains at the current level of

               organizational sophistication, with weak ties and

               somewhat limited means of support and resource

               attainment, it will continue to be a transitory and
^



                                                                    80

               limited "criminal" enterprise.

                    This realization should be considered by policy

               makers who desire to further criminalize computer

               underground activities. Given the current organization

               of the CU, the future social costs of their actions are

               not likely to expand beyond the current level.  There

               is no evidence to support assertions that the CU is

               expanding, and the insight provided here shows that it

               is not likely to do so on a large scale.

                    For sociologists, the computer underground is a

               field rich for insight into several areas of concern.

               Future research into the career path of CU members, and

               the relationships between individuals, could prove

               helpful to those interested in applying theories of

               differential association and career deviance.

               Additionally, the computer underground provides a

               unique opportunity to study the process of

               criminalization, and its effect on those who are

               engaged in the behavior.

                                         Laying a girl V 1.1

     B. The first meets

     E. Phase III. - Actually doing it
    ===================================


    A. Purpose of this guide.
    -------------------------

      Firstly, this isn't a joke guide. All the methods described
    here are working, and with not too much difficulties.

      Don't expect that you will be able to lay a girl in one week.
    Not with this guide anyway. If you have the time, patience, and
    some manners, you will succeed.

      I don't pretend to be a big expert in girls; I'm not.
    But after some experience with them, I can provide you some
    information that can help you, with the first moves between
    he's and her's business.


      I will happily update this guide and improve it, with your
    help, of course. Please send me comments and please help to make
    it better.


         The editor,
         John Smith, Boston
      contact:   in every BBS around...

                        Dedicated to Limor, who helped me to compile it
               without even knowing it...


    B. The first meets
    ------------------

      I believe you have a girlfriend  you can experiment with.
    If you don't, find one. For those purposes, every mid looking
    girl will suit. Every one can owe a girlfriend, and it's not
    the time and place to explain how to reach one. (maybe in the
    next "completed guide of...").

      If you don't have a girlfriend yet, at least try to achieve
    a meet with one.

      If you want to continue seeing this girl you have to remember
   
    * Where to go at the first time:

           - movie (let her choose, but don't insist on doing so)
             You can talk about the movie latter.
                Pay for you both. (as it's obvious). If she's ok, she
             will insist on paying on herself.
        - go for a walk
        - meet at one of your homes. (It's better on her home - she'll
                feel more relaxed and free)
           - party : if available
           - School - only if you learn in the same school
ime, if she is with you, you'll understand that she
        likes your company. If she didn't, you won't reach that stage.
     If she likes you (or love you - in the better case), she would
     more then hugs and kisses -- but don't hurry. You should have
     patience. You should reach the bed only by small steps.


     C. Phase I - "I like you"
     -------------------------

     You (both) will start to say compliments to each other.
     Don't say you love her if you don't feel anything to her.
     Choose the right moment of doing so.

     Imagine the situation: You tell her "I Love you.". She, likes
     you very much, but the way to love is still long.
     She will be in shocking situation. If she'll say "I love you too"
     and she doens't mean it - you will both leave in lie.
     If she'll be silent, you will Probably have bad feelings --
        "She doesn't love me at all.."

     You can say to her "I like you/your looks/your style."
     This isn't strong as "love". Love is very strong word.
     Don't use it when not needed.

     Some guys say to their girls that they love them -
        They think she will jump to the bed right a way.
     Although she will try to show you her greetings, don't expect
     to much. She's just a girl, and if she is between younger then 16.
     she's Probably virgin.

     Bring her flowers & presents some time - it will mean very much
     to her. If you like to write, write her love letters.
     Bring her audio cassette with love songs - she'll remember you
     and connect you to them.


     D. Phase II The body language
     -----------------------------

    You are now on the kings way.

    You should talk about sex by this time. Ask her what she thinks
    about it. (Don't involve doing sex with YOU). Ask her about
    sex generally. Ask her what is the appropriate age for doing it.

    Start investigating her body - only in one of your homes.
    After you kiss her you should get to a situation where
    you are laying one infront of another (on the bed)

       Let your hand travel over her body Don't touch between her
    legs - do the things in the order below.

       Sneak you hand under her skirt and pat her back.
    If she wears a bra put you hand under the stripe (the one
    above her back - but don't open it - let your hand travel under
    the bra surface and forward to her tits. Don't touch hard there -
    it hurts. If she resists get you hand out of there quickly.
    We will continue later with this. Give her 10 minutes of rest
    from the last event. Talk about something else.
    (Remember - Don't ask her why she resists. Just ignore.)

       Another area you should quest is her ass. Pat it gently -
    Stack you hand gently under her trousers and move your hand
    more deeply every time. She'll Probably resist or do sounds
    of disagreement. Remember - Even if she says she's not -
    She like your touches there. By this time you should be friends
    for 1-2 months or so - you know each other enough for those
    games.

       After few meets doing the above, you can try removing her bra.
    The fastest you do it-the better she won't say anything.
    Don't ask her too remove it by herself - You're on you own now.
    after you opened it, don't ask her to totally remove it
    (not at the first time, at least).

       Now it's a very important moment. Remember to close the
    lights,  and get blanket from somewhere. Move you hand down to the
    area of her cunt. (all with clothes, of course).
    Pat her near it - but don't touch it directly. She'll bag in
    her mind from you to do it. After a few minutes of doing so,
    (Don't forget to kiss her all the times...she's not a sex machine)

    Move your hand directly to there. You might feel some bones there
    (and by this time you are wondering where the hall is)

    Don't ask her if it's good to her. It is. Your touch there
    is just like an electrical shock - it's very pleasuring.

          If she's OK, she will do the same to you, so you will both
    feel perfect understand of each other. She might resist to your
    touch, but -believe me- if you'll stop toucing there for a meet
    or so, she will curse herself. The next time you'll try -
    you won't hear a hiss.

       Now...open her trousers. If she'll resist ask her what she
    afraids from. What can possibly happen?
    Start patting her cunt harder and with circulating movements.
    (she is still with her underwear -- don't remove it!)
    Have patience and control yourself.
    If she'll like what you are doing there, and she's OK,
    she will do the same to you. Don't hide your erect penis.
    You can't. But she'll will be amazed from the quick reaction...

          Now your hand is there - circulating over her underwear.
    The best way of directly touching it is to "accidently"
    insert a finger under her underwear. (Do it from her legs side)
    She want resist...don't insert a finger in the hole -
    It can hurt even if she isn't virgin. Remove you fingers from
    there and insert full hand from her stomach side.
    Lay your forehand on her hair, and let the fingers play a little
    down there. Try to locate her clitoris - this is the mega power
    station of emotions... (Open the little lips of her cunt and
    travel up until they meet (the lips) there should be there
    an small organ (About 2-3 cm) - remember:Don't touch there to
    long - it is the most enjoying organ there, but it's not the only.

          Don't forget to kiss her all the times. You can lick her tits
    nipples (not all the girls will let you doing so in that stage)
    Kiss her under her neck and lick her hear.

           Continue touching her there. The lights are off, but try to
    look if her eyes are closed. If they are - she's enjoying.
    If not, continue patting her there - her eyes will be closed
    immediately.

           Try to concentrate on her (girls like attention) but if she
    wants to pleasure you let her doing so. Remember - don't expect
    to much from her. You are the leader in the bed.

           Try to give her an orgasm. A few minutes of direct squeezes
    at her clitoris will do. If it doesn't - ask her what will make
    her good there. Let her instruct you, but don't insist on it.
    If she has a serial of convulsions - she reached it (with your
    help of course). After that she will feel free to do it to you...

           After the next meet she will take a talk with you. She'll say
    that she don't like what you've reached ("..I think we are getting
    to much close to it..."). Ask her "What do you afraid of??
    You had fun didn't you? Look. I don't rowing anywhere.
    I don't know if I want to it yet (I mean full sex)".
    She'll be convinced. She won't start with it when you are doing so-
    she have to much pleasure...

           You are both naked now, beside of your underwear (I hope).
    Now - lay on her.
    Curse the existence of your lower underwear - Loudly.
    Lay her on her back. Massage her for 10 minutes. Kiss her back.
       Now - Remove her underwear completely - she'll fill safe
    because she is on her stomach. (No danger of actual intercourse).
    Remove your pants. Lay on her (She still upside down -remember?)
    She will Probably feel great and hot. Rub your penis against her
    ass chicks. Say to her "would you like me to take some safety
    percations?". She'll say "What do you mean?" answer her:
    "I almost finished...".

       Pull a condom from somewhere (I bet it waited a long time...)
    and put it. Lay again over her and make some moves. Now - Rotate
    her so she'll lay on her back again. Lay over her. Fiddle with her
    cunt a little and try to insert your penis.
    If she'll say "don't insert" - say "ok", wait and retry.

       If it doesn't enter, open her lips with your two hands and try
    again. If she is virgin, it will Probably hurt her a little
    so please be patient and if you are powerful, wait for the next
    meet. (In the next meet throw your parents of your house for the
    day). If it still hurts her, try to expend her virgin membrane
    with your fingers. (There IS a hole there - even if she is totally
    virgin. All you have to do is expend it a little).

                                        Congratulations....


    What if it doesn't work - There are few possibilities:

    - You tried to move too forward with not too much time.
    - She's totally cold (Frigid). Find someone else.
    - She isn't ready yet. Convince her. "What do you have to loose?"
      remember that you must make yourself credit from hers side
    - She is afraid of pregnancy : Wait, or convince her that you
      will take a reliable anti-pregnancy device. (Tell her that
      you'll take condoms; If she's virgin, this is the only
      possibility).

      If she is totally afraid, but want to try sexual intercourse,
      convince her to take anti-pregnancy pills.
      It is vey hard for anyone to admit befor a strange person
      that you're making sexual intercoures; try to understand.
      BTW, the doctors usually don't "insert hands" today.
      (They just test blood pressure and heart beat rate)

      She will give you examples of girls that she READ about that
      used anti-pregnancy devices that failed; tell her "Did you hear
      about all the intercourses which didn't end with pregnancy ?"
      and "Why are you so negative about it?  it's positive thing!"

    - If all above fails and she still don't want it, wait.
      or....merry her...

    All the procedure described here (From totally start) Should
    Take about 3 months. If you're thinking that you are moving
    to quick, slow the rate.


                              John Smith.
